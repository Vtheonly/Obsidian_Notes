To group anagrams from a list of strings, we need a way to identify anagrams. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.

The core idea is to find a "canonical" representation for each string such that all anagrams of a string map to the same canonical form. We can then use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to group strings that share the same canonical representation.

The most common and efficient way to generate this canonical representation for strings composed of lowercase English letters (as specified in the problem constraints) is by using character counts:

1.  **Character Count Key:** For each string:
    *   Create an array of 26 integers (representing counts for 'a' through 'z'), initialized to zeros.
    *   Iterate through the characters of the string. For each character, increment the count at the corresponding index in the array. For instance, for a character `c`, its index in the count array would be `ord(c) - ord('a')`.
    *   This array of counts (e.g., `[1, 0, 1, ...]` for "aca" meaning one 'a', zero 'b's, one 'c', etc.) uniquely represents the multiset of characters in the string.
    *   Since dictionary keys in Python must be hashable, and lists are mutable (and thus not hashable by default), convert this count array into a tuple. For example, "eat" would produce a count array like `[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]` (one 'a', one 'e', one 't'). This list becomes a tuple to be used as the key.

Algorithm Steps:
1.  Initialize an empty dictionary, let's call it `anagram_map`. It's particularly convenient to use `collections.defaultdict(list)` from Python's `collections` module. This type of dictionary automatically creates a new list as the value if a key is accessed for the first time.
2.  Iterate through each string `s` in the input list `strs`.
3.  For each string `s`:
    a.  Compute its character count tuple as described above. This tuple will serve as the `key` for our `anagram_map`.
    b.  Append the original string `s` to the list associated with this `key` in `anagram_map` (e.g., `anagram_map[key].append(s)`).
4.  After iterating through all the strings, the `anagram_map` will contain keys representing unique anagram character sets, and values as lists of strings that are anagrams of each other.
5.  The problem asks for a list of these groups. This can be obtained by taking the values from the `anagram_map` (e.g., `list(anagram_map.values())`).

This character count approach has a time complexity of O(N * M), where N is the number of strings in the input list and M is the maximum length of a string. This is because for each of the N strings, we iterate through its M characters to build the count key. The space complexity is also O(N * M) in the worst-case scenario where all strings are unique and need to be stored. This approach is efficient and suitable for the problem's constraints.

### Complexity Analysis

Let:
*   `N` be the number of strings in the input list `strs`.
*   `M` be the maximum length of a string in `strs`.
*   `A` be the size of the alphabet (in this case, 26 for lowercase English letters).

**1. Time Complexity: O(N * (M + A)) which simplifies to O(N * M)**

*   **Outer loop:** `for s in strs:`
    *   This loop iterates `N` times, once for each string in the input list.
*   **Inside the outer loop (for each string `s`):**
    *   `count = [0] * 26`: Creating the `count` array takes O(A) time (constant time since A=26 is fixed).
    *   `for char in s:`: This inner loop iterates `M` times in the worst case (for the longest string).
        *   `count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1`: Accessing `ord()`, subtracting, array indexing, and incrementing are all O(1) operations. So, this part takes O(M) time in total for one string.
    *   `canonical_key = tuple(count)`: Converting the `count` list (of size `A`) to a tuple takes O(A) time.
    *   `anagram_map[canonical_key].append(s)`:
        *   Hashing the `canonical_key` (a tuple of size `A`): This typically takes O(A) time.
        *   Dictionary insertion/lookup: On average, this is O(1) after the key is hashed. In the worst-case (many hash collisions), it could be O(number of items in dict), but Python's dict implementation is highly optimized, so we usually consider the average case for hashing and lookup.
        *   Appending to a list: `append(s)` is an amortized O(1) operation.

*   **Total Time:** For each of the `N` strings, the work done is roughly `O(A)` (for count init) + `O(M)` (for char counting) + `O(A)` (for tuple conversion) + `O(A)` (for hashing the key).
    So, the total time is `N * (M + A + A + A) = N * (M + 3A)`.
    Since `A` (26) is a constant, it doesn't dominate `M` (which can be up to 100). Thus, we can simplify this to **O(N * M)**. If `M` were very small and `A` was variable and large, then `O(N*A)` might be more accurate, but given the problem constraints, `M` is the more significant variable factor per string.

**2. Space Complexity: O(N * M + U * A) which simplifies to O(N * M)**

*   `anagram_map`: This dictionary stores all the original strings. In the worst case, all `N` strings could be unique and stored, occupying a total space proportional to the sum of their lengths. If each string has an average length of `M_avg`, this is `O(N * M_avg)`. In the absolute worst case (one very long string or many strings of max length `M`), this is **O(N * M)**.
*   The keys of `anagram_map`: Each unique anagram group will have one key. A key is a tuple of `A` integers. If there are `U` unique anagram groups, the space for keys is `O(U * A)`. In the worst case, `U` could be `N` (if no strings are anagrams of each other). So this could be `O(N * A)`.
*   `count`: This is a temporary list of size `A` (26). It's reused for each string, so it takes O(A) auxiliary space, which is O(1) as `A` is constant.
*   Output list: The problem requires returning a list of lists of strings. This also stores all the original strings, contributing `O(N * M)` to the space if we consider the output. If we only consider auxiliary space *excluding* the output, then `anagram_map` is the dominant factor.

*   **Total Space:** The dominant factor is storing the strings themselves in the `anagram_map` and eventually in the output. So, the space complexity is primarily **O(N * M)**. The `U * A` for keys is typically smaller than `N * M` or of a similar order when `M` is not very small.

### What `tuple` does and why it's used:

A **tuple** in Python is:
1.  **An ordered collection of items:** Like a list, items in a tuple have a defined order, and you can access them by their index (e.g., `my_tuple[0]`).
2.  **Immutable:** This is the key difference from a list. Once a tuple is created, you **cannot change its contents**. You cannot add new items, remove existing items, or change an item at a specific index.

**Why `tuple` is used here (as a dictionary key):**

*   **Dictionary Keys Must Be Hashable:** In Python, dictionary keys must be "hashable." An object is hashable if it has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method) and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects that compare as equal must have the same hash value.
*   **Mutable Objects (like lists) are Generally Not Hashable:** Lists are mutable. You can change a list after it's created (e.g., `my_list.append(5)` or `my_list[0] = 'new_value'`). If lists were allowed as dictionary keys, and you modified a list that was being used as a key, the dictionary's internal structure could become corrupted. The dictionary might not be able to find the entry anymore because its hash value (if it were based on its contents) would have changed.
*   **Tuples are Immutable, Hence Hashable (if their contents are):** Because tuples cannot be changed after creation, they can be hashable *if all the items they contain are also hashable*. In our case, the `count` list contains integers, which are hashable. When we convert `count` to `tuple(count)`, we get an immutable sequence of integers. This tuple can then safely be used as a dictionary key.

**In the code:**
```python
count = [0] * 26
# ... (populate count)
canonical_key = tuple(count) # Converts the list 'count' into a tuple
anagram_map[canonical_key].append(s)
```
1.  `count` is a list, e.g., `[1, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 1, ..., 0]` for "eat".
2.  `tuple(count)` converts this list into an immutable tuple, e.g., `(1, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 1, ..., 0)`.
3.  This tuple `canonical_key` is then used as the key in `anagram_map`. All strings that are anagrams of each other (like "eat", "tea", "ate") will produce the exact same `count` list, and therefore the exact same `canonical_key` tuple. This allows us to group them together under that single key in the dictionary.

If we tried to use the `count` list directly as a key (`anagram_map[count].append(s)`), Python would raise a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`.
