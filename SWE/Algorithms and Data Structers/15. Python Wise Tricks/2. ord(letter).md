# Character Comparisons in Python

## Clarification of the Question
Can you compare characters directly in Python, such as `'A' < 'b'`?

---

## Core Idea
Yes, you can compare characters in Python using comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.).  
This works because Python stores characters as strings of length one, and their comparisons are based on their **Unicode code points**.

---

## ASCII / Unicode Basics
- ASCII defines characters with numeric codes from 0 to 127.  
- Unicode extends this to cover many languages and symbols.  
- In Python, `ord(char)` gives you the numeric code point, and `chr(number)` gives you back the character.

### Example
```python
print(ord('A'))  # 65
print(ord('b'))  # 98
print('A' < 'b') # True, because 65 < 98
````

---

## Ordering of Characters

- Uppercase letters `'A'`–`'Z'` map to 65–90.
    
- Lowercase letters `'a'`–`'z'` map to 97–122.
    
- Therefore:
    
    - All uppercase letters come before all lowercase letters in standard comparisons.
        
    - `'Z' < 'a'` is `True`.
        

---

## Useful Functions

- `ord(ch)` → Returns the Unicode code point (integer).
    
- `chr(num)` → Returns the character for that code point.
    

### Examples

```python
print(ord('A'))   # 65
print(ord('Z'))   # 90
print(ord('a'))   # 97
print(ord('z'))   # 122

print(chr(65))    # 'A'
print(chr(122))   # 'z'
```

---

## Practical Use Cases

- **Alphabet ordering**: Compare characters directly to sort words or letters.
    
- **Custom logic**: Convert characters into positions in the alphabet for cryptography, indexing, or encoding.
    
- **Case-insensitive comparison**: Convert both sides to lowercase or uppercase before comparing.
    

### Example

```python
print('A'.lower() < 'b'.lower()) # False, because both become 'a' and 'b'
```

## Summary

- `'A' < 'b'` is `True` in Python, because 65 < 98.
    
- Comparisons are based on Unicode code points.
    
- `ord()` and `chr()` allow you to move between characters and numeric values.
    
- Always consider case sensitivity when designing string comparisons.
