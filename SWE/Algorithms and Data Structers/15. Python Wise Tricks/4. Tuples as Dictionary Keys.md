## Clarifying the Context

When working with hash-based data structures in Python (like dictionaries or sets), the **keys** must be immutable and hashable. Lists are mutable, so they cannot be used directly as dictionary keys. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable and hashable, which makes them valid keys.

A common example is grouping **anagrams** by using their sorted characters as a key.

## Tuples vs Lists

- **List (`[]`)**
    
    - Mutable (can change after creation)
        
    - Not hashable
        
    - Cannot be used as dictionary keys
        
- **Tuple (`()`)**
    
    - Immutable (cannot change after creation)
        
    - Hashable (if all elements inside are hashable)
        
    - Can be used as dictionary keys

## Why Tuples Work as Keys

Python requires keys to be:

1. **Immutable** – so the key does not change after insertion.
    
2. **Hashable** – so Python can compute a hash value for fast lookup.
    

Example:

```python
# Using a tuple as a dictionary key
my_dict = {}
my_dict[(1, 2, 3)] = "valid key"
print(my_dict)  # {(1, 2, 3): 'valid key'}

# Trying with a list (error)
my_dict[[1, 2, 3]] = "invalid key"
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

## Example: Grouping Anagrams

When solving the **Group Anagrams** problem:

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    ans = {}
    for s in strs:
        # Step 1: Sort the string → gives a list of chars
        s_sorted = sorted(s)          # e.g., "eat" → ['a', 'e', 't']

        # Step 2: Convert list into a tuple (immutable)
        key = tuple(s_sorted)         # ('a', 'e', 't')

        # Step 3: Use tuple as dict key
        if key not in ans:
            ans[key] = [s]
        else:
            ans[key].append(s)

    return list(ans.values())
```

Input:

```python
["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
```

Output:

```python
[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]
```

---

## Alternatives

Instead of tuples, you could also use a **string key**:

```python
key = ''.join(sorted(s))  # e.g., "eat" → "aet"
```

This works because strings are also immutable and hashable.

## Key Takeaways

- Tuples are immutable and hashable → safe for use as dictionary keys.
    
- They are useful when you need a **composite key** (multiple values grouped together).
    
- In problems like **grouping anagrams**, tuples represent sorted characters uniquely.

Do you want me to extend this note with a **comparison between using tuple keys vs string keys** (performance and readability differences), or keep it focused only on tuples?
