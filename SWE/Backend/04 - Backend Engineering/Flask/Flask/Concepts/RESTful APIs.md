You're asking about:

- What are REST APIs?
    
- What are RESTful APIs?
    
- How are they different from "normal" web APIs?
    

Let’s break this down systematically.

---

##  What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a contract that allows different software components to **communicate with each other**.

A **Web API** is an API that uses **HTTP** as the communication protocol. You make requests like:

```http
GET /users
POST /login
```

And receive structured responses — usually in **JSON**.

---

##  REST vs RESTful vs Normal APIs

Let’s define them precisely:

---

## 1.  What is a REST API?

**REST** stands for **REpresentational State Transfer** — a set of **architectural constraints** introduced by Roy Fielding in 2000.

A **REST API** follows these **rules or constraints**:

|Constraint|Description|
|---|---|
|Stateless|Each request is self-contained (no memory on server between requests)|
|Uniform Interface|Standardized routes (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`) and HTTP methods|
|Client-Server Separation|The client and server operate independently|
|Cacheable|Responses can be cached when appropriate|
|Layered System|APIs can be served via proxies, load balancers, etc.|
|Code-on-Demand (optional)|Servers can send executable code (rarely used)|

A REST API uses **standard HTTP methods** to operate on **resources**:

|HTTP Method|Action|Example|
|---|---|---|
|GET|Read|`/users/123`|
|POST|Create|`/users`|
|PUT|Update|`/users/123`|
|DELETE|Delete|`/users/123`|

---

## 2.  What is a RESTful API?

This term gets used **interchangeably with REST API**, but strictly speaking:

>  A **RESTful API** is an API that **conforms to REST principles**.

So the difference is mostly **semantic**:

- "REST API" = The general concept
    
- "RESTful API" = An API that strictly **implements** the REST architecture
    

You can think of it like:

- OOP = Object-Oriented Programming (the concept)
    
- Object-Oriented = A style that follows OOP principles
    

So unless someone is being hyper-specific, **REST API and RESTful API mean the same thing** in practice.

---

## 3.  What Is a “Normal Web API”?

This term is vague — people use it to refer to **any API exposed over the web**, regardless of whether it follows REST or not.

So this could include:

- REST APIs (stateless, resource-based)
    
- SOAP APIs (XML-based, stateful)
    
- GraphQL APIs (query language for APIs)
    
- gRPC APIs (binary communication using Protocol Buffers)
    
- JSON-RPC (remote procedure calls over JSON)
    

So:

> "Web API" is the umbrella term.  
> REST API is one specific **style** of Web API.

---

##  Comparison Table

|Feature|RESTful API|Non-REST API (e.g., RPC)|Web API (General)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stateless| Yes| Maybe|/ Depends|
|URL = Resource| Yes (`/users/123`)| Often RPC-style (`/getUser`)|/ Depends|
|Uses HTTP Methods| Yes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)| Often just POST| Usually|
|Data Format|JSON (common), XML|JSON, XML, or binary|JSON, XML, anything|
|Schema Flexibility| Structured but flexible|Often rigid|Depends|
|Self-Descriptive URLs|||Depends|

##  Visual Analogy

```
                     ┌─────────────┐
                     │  Web API    │ ← umbrella term
                     └─────┬───────┘
                           ↓
    ┌────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
    │  REST API  │    │  GraphQL API  │    │   SOAP API  │
    └────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └─────────────┘
         ↓
 ┌────────────────────┐
 │  RESTful API (strictly follows REST) │
 └────────────────────┘
```

##  Final Summary

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|REST API|API that follows REST design principles|
|RESTful API|A REST API that closely adheres to the constraints|
|Web API|Any API exposed over HTTP — may be REST, GraphQL, SOAP, etc.|

If you'd like, I can give you code examples showing:

- A RESTful route in Flask
    
- A "non-RESTful" RPC-style route
    
- A comparison between REST and GraphQL
    


##  REST API Example — Pure Conceptual Walkthrough

###  Resource: `Book`

Let’s say we are building an API to manage a book collection.

The **resource** is:

```
/books
```

Each book is represented as:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "1984",
  "author": "George Orwell"
}
```

---

##  REST Endpoints Design

|Action|HTTP Method|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Get all books|`GET`|`/books`|Returns all books|
|Get book by ID|`GET`|`/books/1`|Returns book with ID = 1|
|Add new book|`POST`|`/books`|Creates a new book|
|Update book|`PUT`|`/books/1`|Updates book with ID = 1|
|Delete book|`DELETE`|`/books/1`|Deletes book with ID = 1|

---

##  How to Use It (Raw `curl` Examples)

###  Get all books

```bash
curl http://example.com/books
```

**Server Response:**

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley" }
]
```

---

###  Create a new book

```bash
curl -X POST http://example.com/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert"}'
```

**Server Response:**

```json
{ "id": 3, "title": "Dune", "author": "Frank Herbert" }
```

---

###  Update a book

```bash
curl -X PUT http://example.com/books/3 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Dune Messiah", "author": "Frank Herbert"}'
```

**Server Response:**

```json
{ "id": 3, "title": "Dune Messiah", "author": "Frank Herbert" }
```

---

###  Delete a book

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://example.com/books/3
```

**Server Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

##  Key REST Concepts Reflected Here

1. **Resource-Oriented**  
    Everything is centered around `books`, accessed via `/books`.
    
2. **Stateless**  
    Each request contains all needed data. Server stores no client session info.
    
3. **HTTP Verbs = Actions**
    
    - `GET`: read
        
    - `POST`: create
        
    - `PUT`: update
        
    - `DELETE`: remove
        
4. **Standard HTTP Codes**
    
    - `200 OK`: Success
        
    - `201 Created`: POST success
        
    - `204 No Content`: DELETE success
        
    - `404 Not Found`: Resource missing
        
    - `400 Bad Request`: Bad input

##  REST Is Just a Convention

REST is not limited to any tech stack.

You can build RESTful APIs in:

- Python (Flask, Django REST)
    
- Node.js (Express)
    
- Java (Spring Boot)
    
- C# (.NET Web API)
    
- Go (Echo, Gin)
    
- Rust (Actix)
    
- ...or even just raw NGINX or bash scripts
    

---

##  Summary

- REST = **Representational State Transfer**
    
- It’s a **set of rules** for how to design web APIs
    
- You interact with **resources via URLs** and **HTTP methods**
    
- It’s **stateless, structured, and predictable**
