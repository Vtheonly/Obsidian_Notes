## Clarifying the Problem

You attempted to push to the GitHub repository `Store_Worcraft` but received:

```
remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
fatal: Authentication failed
```

You already have a Personal Access Token (PAT), but Git seems to be either:

1. Using cached (outdated) credentials.
    
2. Failing because the token is invalid or expired.

## Cause

Since August 13, 2021, GitHub **no longer supports password authentication** for Git operations over HTTPS.  
Instead, you must use:

- A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with HTTPS, or
    
- An SSH key with Git over SSH.
    

The error indicates:

- Git tried to authenticate using a **password** (likely from the credential cache).
    
- Your PAT was either expired, invalid, or not supplied.

## Solution – Using a Personal Access Token (HTTPS Method)

1. **Create a new Personal Access Token (if needed)**
    
    - Go to [GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
        
    - Click **Generate new token**
        
    - Choose:
        
        - Expiration (set it to `No expiration` if you want long-term use)
            
        - Scopes: at least `repo` and `workflow`
            
    - Copy the token (you won’t be able to see it again).
        
2. **Clear cached credentials**
    
    ```bash
    git credential-cache exit
    git credential-cache --timeout=1
    git credential-cache exit
    ```
    
    Or manually remove from:
    
    ```bash
    git credential-cache exit
    git credential-cache exit
    ```
    
    For Linux systems with `libsecret`:
    
    ```bash
    git credential-reject
    ```
    
3. **Set the remote URL with username**
    
    ```bash
    git remote set-url Store_Worcraft https://Vtheonly@github.com/Vtheonly/Store_Worcraft
    ```
    
4. **Push and enter PAT**
    
    ```bash
    git push -u Store_Worcraft main
    ```
    
    When prompted for a password, paste the **Personal Access Token**.

## Alternative – SSH Method (Recommended for long term)

1. **Generate SSH key**
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    
    Press Enter for default save location and optionally set a passphrase.
    
2. **Add SSH key to GitHub**
    
    - Copy key:
        
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
        
    - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key → Paste.
        
3. **Set remote to SSH**
    
    ```bash
    git remote set-url Store_Worcraft git@github.com:Vtheonly/Store_Worcraft.git
    ```
    
4. **Push**
    
    ```bash
    git push -u Store_Worcraft main
    ```

## Quick Troubleshooting Tips

- If Git keeps using old credentials, run:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global --unset credential.helper
    ```
    
- Verify token works by cloning:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://<username>@github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
    ```
    

---

If you want, I can make you a **one-command fix** that both clears your old credentials and pushes with a fresh PAT prompt. That way you won’t keep hitting this error.
