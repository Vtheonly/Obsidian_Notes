The main error here is:

```
fatal: ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref
```

That means your local Git repo does not know what the default branch is for the `origin` remote, so commands or tools (like VS Code) that expect `origin/HEAD` to point to something (like `origin/main` or `origin/master`) fail to resolve it.

### Obsidian Note – Git `origin/HEAD` Not a Symbolic Ref

#### **Context / Clarification**

When using Git with remote repositories (especially in tools like VS Code), Git often references `origin/HEAD` as the default branch pointer.  
If `origin/HEAD` is missing or broken, you'll see:

```
fatal: ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref
```

---

#### **Cause**

- Your remote (`origin`) does not have its default branch set locally.
    
- This usually happens if:
    
    - You cloned a repo but never fetched all branches.
        
    - The remote’s default branch changed and your local ref didn’t update.
        
    - You created the repo locally and added a remote without setting the upstream HEAD.
        

---

#### **How to Fix**

To explicitly set the remote’s HEAD to point to your main branch:

```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```

or manually:

```bash
git remote set-head origin main
```

(Replace `main` with `master` or your default branch name.)

---

#### **Why It Matters**

- Without `origin/HEAD`, Git GUIs and some scripts cannot guess your default branch.
    
- Tools like `git clone` normally set it automatically, but if you create the repo differently or the remote changes, it must be fixed manually.

#### **Tip**

After fixing, verify with:

```bash
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
```

Expected output:

```
refs/remotes/origin/main
```
