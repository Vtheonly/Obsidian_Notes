> [!question] Because the $3 \times 3$ high-pass kernel is symmetric along both the horizontal and vertical axes ($h(i, j) = h(-i, -j)$), 2D convolution and 2D cross-correlation yield identical numerical expressions for this kernel.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> True

> [!question] Zero padding preserves the local intensity continuity at the image border, so the high-pass filter response at the corner pixel stays close to zero.
>> [!success]- Answer
