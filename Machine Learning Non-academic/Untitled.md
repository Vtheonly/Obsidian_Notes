Got it. I’ll give you a **sample Obsidian note** based on your fixed prompt. This will show exactly how a single note could look: polished, structured, and limited to 5–8 bullet-point keywords.

# Sample Note – Introduction to APIs

## Corrected Context

The topic covers the basic idea of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), their purpose, and why developers use them.

---

## Definition

> An **API** is a structured way for software applications to communicate with each other using defined rules and protocols.

---

## Key Points

- Software communication
    
- Rules and protocols
    
- Abstraction of complexity
    
- Data exchange
    
- REST & GraphQL
    
- Developer productivity
    

---

## Table Example

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|REST|Uses HTTP methods, simple & common|
|GraphQL|Flexible queries, single endpoint|
|SOAP|XML-based, strict, legacy-oriented|

---

## Notes

- APIs allow developers to focus on **logic** instead of reinventing connectivity.
    
- Good API design emphasizes **simplicity**, **security**, and **scalability**.

## Warning!

- Poorly documented APIs can lead to **integration errors** and wasted development time.

Would you like me to expand this into a **multi-note Obsidian vault sample** (e.g., one for APIs, one for Databases, one for Debugging, etc.) so you can see how consistency across notes would look?
