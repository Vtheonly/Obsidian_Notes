This is only an example. Please follow the **structure** of the quiz, not the content or subject matter itself.

I have an app that processes Markdown to generate puzzles and other interactive elements. The format used is extremely specific and must be followed **exactly** when generating content.

 It is **critically important** to strictly adhere to the given format.
 As you can see, there are **three types** of questions currently supported, but you can create **more than one question per type**.

 You can include any number of questions in **any sequence**, and use any of the following types:

 * **True or False**
 * **Matching**
 * **Multiple Choice** (with only one correct answer among the options)

 Please make sure the structure remains consistent regardless of the question type.
