### Toast

A Toast is a small pop-up message that appears on the screen to convey information to the user. It typically appears for a short duration and disappears automatically without requiring any user interaction.

```java
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, "Here is our first toast", Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
toast.show();
```

- `Toast.makeText()`: This method creates a new Toast object with the specified text message.
- `this`: The first parameter represents the context in which the Toast should appear.
- `"Here is our first toast"`: The second parameter is the text message to be displayed in the Toast.
- `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`: The third parameter specifies the duration for which the Toast should be displayed. It can be either `Toast.LENGTH_SHORT` for a shorter duration or `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` for a longer duration.
- `toast.show()`: Finally, the `show()` method is called to display the Toast on the screen.

Using Toasts can provide users with quick feedback or information without interrupting their workflow, making them a useful tool for enhancing the user experience in an Android application.
