Certainly! Here's the information about `TableLayout`:

**TableLayout** organizes elements in a table-like structure, similar to HTML tables but without visible borders.

- To construct a row in the table, we use the `<TableRow>` tag.
- Each cell within the table can contain a `View` object.

This layout is useful for arranging elements in a grid-like manner, suitable for forms, data displays, or any scenario where a tabular organization is needed.
