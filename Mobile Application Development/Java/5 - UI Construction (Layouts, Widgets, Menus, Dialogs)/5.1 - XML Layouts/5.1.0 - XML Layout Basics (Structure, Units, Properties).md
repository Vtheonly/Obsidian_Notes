**Fundamental Concept:**
Android User Interfaces (UIs) are constructed using a hierarchy of `View` and `ViewGroup` objects. XML (Extensible Markup Language) provides a structured, human-readable way to define this hierarchy and the properties of each element, separating the UI *design* from the application's *behavior* (Java/Kotlin code).

**How Interfaces are Defined:**
There are two primary ways to define an interface ([Interface Utilisateur p3]):
1.  **XML Description:** This is the preferred and most common method. Layouts are defined in dedicated XML files.
2.  Programmatically: Interfaces can also be built directly in Java/Kotlin code, but this is less common for static layouts as it mixes design and logic.

**XML File Structure & Location:**
*   **Location:** XML files describing a specific interface layout are placed within the project's `res/layout/` directory ([Graphical interfaces p3], [Interface Utilisateur p9]).
*   **Referencing:** These layout files are automatically indexed by the Android build system and can be referenced in code using the `R` class, specifically `R.layout.your_layout_filename` (e.g., `R.layout.activity_main`) ([Graphical interfaces p3], [Interface Utilisateur p9]).
*   **Loading in Activity:** An Activity brings an XML layout to the screen using the `setContentView(R.layout.your_layout_filename)` method, typically called within the Activity's `onCreate()` method ([Graphical interfaces p3], [Interface Utilisateur p9, p16]).
*   **Basic XML Form:** ([Interface Utilisateur p12, p13])
    *   Must be "well-formed" XML.
    *   Starts with an optional XML prolog (e.g., `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>`).
    *   Must have **exactly one root element**.
*   **Root Element:** ([Graphical interfaces p4, p5], [Interface Utilisateur p11, p14])
    *   This single top-level element must be a `View` or, more commonly, a `ViewGroup` (like `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, etc.).
    *   It must declare the Android XML namespace to access standard Android attributes: `xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"`.
    *   It contains all other nested UI elements (Views and ViewGroups).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">

    <!-- Other Views and ViewGroups are nested inside the root element -->
    <TextView ... />
    <Button ... />

</LinearLayout>
```

**Core Building Blocks: View and ViewGroup:**
*   **`View`:** ([Graphical interfaces p3], [Interface Utilisateur p10])
    *   The fundamental UI building block.
    *   Occupies a rectangular area on the screen.
    *   Responsible for drawing itself and handling user interaction events.
    *   Base class for **widgets** (interactive components like `Button`, `TextView`, `EditText`, etc.).
*   **`ViewGroup`:** ([Graphical interfaces p3], [Interface Utilisateur p10])
    *   A subclass of `View`.
    *   Acts as an invisible **container** to hold other `View`s and/or `ViewGroup`s.
    *   Defines the **layout properties** for its children, arranging them on the screen (e.g., `LinearLayout` arranges children linearly).

**Units of Measurement:** ([Graphical interfaces p6], [Interface Utilisateur p17])
Dimensions (like size, margins, padding) are specified using various units:
*   `px` (Pixels): Actual pixels on the screen. Use sparingly as it doesn't scale well across different screen densities.
*   `in` (Inches): Based on the physical size of the screen.
*   `mm` (Millimeters): Based on the physical size of the screen.
*   `pt` (Points): 1/72 of an inch.
*   **`dp` or `dip` (Density-independent Pixels):** *Highly recommended for most dimensions.* An abstract unit based on screen density. Aims for consistent physical size across screens (1dp â‰ˆ 1px on a 160dpi screen).
*   **`sp` (Scale-independent Pixels):** *Highly recommended for text sizes.* Similar to `dp` but also scales according to the user's preferred font size setting on the device.
*   **Syntax:** Units are appended directly to the value (e.g., `"16dp"`, `"14sp"`, `"2mm"`).

**Common Properties (Focus: `android:id`):** ([Graphical interfaces p8], [Interface Utilisateur p18, p19])
*   **`android:id`:** Assigns a unique identifier to a View within the layout hierarchy (or across the application's resources).
    *   **Purpose:** Allows the View to be referenced from:
        *   Java/Kotlin code (using `findViewById(R.id.your_id)`).
        *   Other XML elements (e.g., for positioning in `RelativeLayout` using `@id/your_id`).
    *   **Syntax:** `android:id="@+id/some_unique_name"`
        *   `@+id/`: The `@` indicates a resource reference, the `+` signifies that a *new* ID resource should be created in the `R.java` file if it doesn't already exist, and `id` is the resource type.
    *   **Necessity:** Not all elements *need* an ID. Only assign IDs to Views you need to access from code or reference from other XML attributes.
    *   **Referencing Existing ID:** To reference an ID already defined (e.g., in RelativeLayout rules), omit the `+`: `android:layout_below="@id/some_unique_name"`.
