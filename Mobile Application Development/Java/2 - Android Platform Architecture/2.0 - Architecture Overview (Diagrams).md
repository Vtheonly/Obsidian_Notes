# Android Platform Architecture

The Android platform is structured as a software stack comprising several layers. Each layer builds upon the one below it, providing different services and functionalities.

*(Self-correction: Since I cannot directly embed images, assume a representative diagram like the ones from Deck 3, Slide 23 or Deck 4, Slide 6 is placed here or described below)*

**Diagram Description:** The architecture is typically shown as layers: Applications at the top, followed by Application Framework, then Libraries and Android Runtime side-by-side, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and the Linux Kernel at the base.

## Applications Layer

*   **Description:** This is the top layer of the Android architecture. It's where the user interacts with the device.
*   **Content:** Includes both the core system applications (like Phone/Dialer, Contacts, Browser, SMS, Email, Calendar, Camera, Clock, Maps, Calculator) and any third-party applications installed by the user.
*   **Development:** Your own applications are written to be installed and run at this level, typically using the Java or Kotlin programming language.
*   **Visibility:** This is the only layer directly accessible and visible to the end-user.

## Application Framework Layer

*   **Description:** Provides the high-level building blocks and services that application developers use to create rich and innovative applications. It's an open development platform.
*   **Functionality:** Offers APIs (primarily Java-based classes) that allow developers to take advantage of core system features and hardware.
*   **Key Components/Managers:**
    *   **Activity Manager:** Manages the lifecycle of applications and maintains the navigation backstack.
    *   **Package Manager:** Used by the Activity Manager to get information about installed applications from their `.apk` files.
    *   **Window Manager:** Manages the windows of applications, determining which window is displayed on the screen.
    *   **Resource Manager:** Provides access to non-code resources like strings, graphics (images), layout files, audio files, etc.
    *   **Notification Manager:** Allows applications to display custom alerts and notifications in the status bar.
    *   **Content Providers:** Enables applications to share data with other applications (e.g., accessing contacts). Data can be stored in SQLite databases, files, or over the network.
    *   **View System:** Provides the fundamental UI building blocks like lists, grids, text boxes, buttons, and even an embedded web browser component.
    *   **Telephony Manager:** Provides information about the telephony services on the device (e.g., network status, SIM information).
    *   **Location Manager:** Provides access to location services like GPS.
*   **Services Concept:** Android introduces the concept of Services, which are application components that can run in the background without a direct user interface (e.g., playing music while using another app).

## Libraries Layer

*   **Description:** This layer contains a set of native (C/C++) libraries used by various components of the Android system. Many core Android system features are built upon these native libraries.
*   **Accessibility:** Developers typically access these libraries through the APIs provided by the Application Framework layer.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Media Framework / Multimedia Libraries:** Supports playback and recording of various common audio and video formats (e.g., MPEG4, H.264, MP3, AAC, AMR, JPG, PNG, GIF).
    *   **Surface Manager:** Manages access to the display subsystem and composites graphic layers from multiple applications.
    *   **Skia:** The core 2D graphics rendering engine for Android UI.
    *   **OpenGL ES:** APIs for hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics rendering.
    *   **SQLite:** A lightweight relational database engine used for application data storage.
    *   **WebKit:** The web browser rendering engine (used by WebView and historically the default Browser app).
    *   **FreeType:** Font rendering engine.
    *   **SSL:** Provides Secure Socket Layer encryption for internet security.
    *   **Libc:** A standard C system library tuned for embedded Linux-based devices.

## Android Runtime (ART & Dalvik)

*   **Description:** This layer provides the environment where Android applications execute.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Core Libraries:** Provides most of the functionality available in the core libraries of the Java programming language.
    *   **Virtual Machine:**
        *   **Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) (Historical - Up to Android 4.4):** An optimized virtual machine specifically designed for mobile devices with constraints like limited battery life and memory. It executed `.dex` (Dalvik Executable) bytecode, which is converted from standard Java bytecode during the build process. Dalvik allowed multiple applications to run efficiently, each within its own process and DVM instance, leveraging Linux kernel features for memory management and threading.
        *   **Android RunTime (ART) (Android 5.0+):** Replaced Dalvik as the default runtime. ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, compiling application bytecode into native machine code upon installation. This generally leads to faster app launch times and improved performance compared to Dalvik's Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, though it may result in slightly longer install times and larger app storage footprints. ART maintains compatibility with DEX bytecode.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

*   **Description:** Provides standard interfaces that expose device hardware capabilities to the higher-level Java API framework. The HAL sits between the Android framework and the Linux kernel drivers.
*   **Purpose:** It allows Android to be agnostic about lower-level driver implementations. Each hardware component (e.g., camera, Bluetooth) requires a corresponding HAL implementation provided by the hardware manufacturer.
*   **Functionality:** Consists of multiple library modules, each implementing an interface for a specific type of hardware component (e.g., Camera HAL, Audio HAL, Bluetooth HAL, Sensors HAL). The Android system loads these library modules when needed.
*   **Access:** Services like CameraService, AudioFlinger, etc., rely on the HAL interfaces to communicate with the hardware.

## Linux Kernel Layer

*   **Description:** The foundation of the Android platform. Android is built on top of the Linux kernel.
*   **Role:** Acts as an abstraction layer between the device hardware and the rest of the software stack.
*   **Core System Services:** Manages essential system functions such as:
    *   **Process Management:** Creating, managing, and terminating application processes.
    *   **Memory Management:** Allocating and managing system memory.
    *   **Security:** Enforcing application permissions and sandboxing.
    *   **Network Stack:** Handling network communication (TCP/IP, etc.).
    *   **Driver Model:** Contains drivers for the device's hardware.
*   **Hardware Drivers:** Includes low-level drivers for interacting with the physical hardware components like Display, Camera, Keypad/Touchscreen, WiFi, Bluetooth, Audio, USB, GPS, Sensors, Power Management, and Binder (IPC mechanism).
