### **Applications Layer**

The topmost layer where users interact with installed apps, both system and third-party. Itâ€™s the only layer directly accessible by users and is developed using the Android SDK in Java or Kotlin.

---

### **Application Framework Layer**

Provides APIs and system services like Activity Manager and Notification Manager to support application development. It exposes hardware and system features in a developer-friendly way.

---

### **Libraries Layer**

A set of C/C++ libraries providing essential capabilities like media playback, database access (SQLite), graphics (Skia/OpenGL), and web rendering (WebKit), underpinning much of the Android system.

---

### **Android Runtime (ART & Dalvik)**

Executes Android apps via the ART or legacy Dalvik virtual machine. ART uses Ahead-Of-Time compilation for better performance, while core libraries mimic Java's standard library.

---

### **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**

Acts as a bridge between the Android system and hardware-specific drivers. It provides standard interfaces for hardware components like camera, sensors, and Bluetooth.

---

### **Linux Kernel Layer**

The lowest layer offering core services like process and memory management, security, and networking. It also hosts hardware drivers that interface directly with the physical components.
