The AndroidManifest.xml file serves as a comprehensive descriptor of the attributes and components of the application, outlining its functionality and appearance.


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapplication"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">

    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15"
        android:targetSdkVersion="23"/>

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="My Application"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/AppTheme">

        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

    </application>

</manifest>
```



## Application Attributes

The `<application>` element encapsulates various attributes that define the behavior and appearance of the application:

- `android:allowBackup="true"`: Enables backup of application data.
- `android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"`: Specifies the application icon.
- `android:label="My Application"`: Sets the label or name of the application.
- `android:supportsRtl="true"`: Indicates support for right-to-left layouts.
- `android:theme="@style/AppTheme"`: Defines the theme applied to the application.

## Declaration of Activities

Within the `<application>` element, activities are declared to specify the different screens or functionalities within the application. By default, an Android application has one main activity.

```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

This snippet declares the main activity of the application, denoted by `MainActivity`. Additionally, it specifies that this activity is the entry point to the application, as indicated by the `android.intent.action.MAIN` action and `android.intent.category.LAUNCHER` category within the intent filter.

This configuration ensures that when the application is launched, the main activity is displayed as the initial screen.

## SDK Version Specifications

To utilize this application, users must have Android version API 15 or higher installed on their devices. This ensures that the application functions optimally and takes advantage of newer features available in higher Android versions. Consequently, the application will only be available for download on the Google Play Store for devices running Android version 15 or above.

```xml
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="15"
    android:targetSdkVersion="23" />
```


The application is designed and tested to fully function on devices with SDK version 23. This version serves as the baseline for ensuring the application's compatibility and performance.

```xml
<uses-sdk android:maxSdkVersion="25"/>
```

Users with Android versions equal to or lower than API 25 can still use the application without encountering compatibility issues.

This information within the AndroidManifest.xml file ensures that the application is accessible to a wide range of users while maintaining compatibility and performance standards across different Android versions.
