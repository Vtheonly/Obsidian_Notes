## Composition of an application

An application is made up of several activities. Each manages a user interaction screen and is defined by a Java class.

A complex application may also contain:
*   **Services**: these are processes that run in the background.
*   **Content providers**: they represent a kind of database.
*   **Broadcast receivers**: to manage events sent by the system to all applications.

## Application permissions

An Android application is in a **sandbox** and if it needs to use information outside its scope it will need permission.
*   A **sandbox** is a security mechanism which consists of reserving a space in which programs can be used while remaining isolated from the rest of the system.

An application must declare the permissions it needs: internet access, camera, contact, GPS, etc.

This is done by adding elements to the manifest (`AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<manifest ... >
    ......
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    ......
</manifest>
```

See this page for the list of existing permissions:
*   [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html)

## Starting an application

At first, Android system starts the activity which is marked `action=MAIN` and `category=LAUNCHER` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
Then other activities can be started. Each one places itself “in front” of the others like on a stack.

Example of an activity marked as startable in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<activity android:name=".MainActivity" ...>
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

## Context of an application

*   Is a global object that lives throughout the operation of an application.
*   To get it: `Context context = this.getApplicationContext();`
*   It contains information about the current state of the application and is a link to the Android system and other application activities.

## Activities

An Activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. Almost all activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with `setContentView(View)`.

### States of an Activity:
An activity is in one of these states:
*   **active (resumed)**: it is on the front, and the user can play with it.
*   **paused**: partially hidden and inactive, because another activity has come in front.
*   **stopped**: totally invisible and inactive, its variables are preserved but it no longer runs.

### State change events
The Activity class receives events from the Android system by calling functions called **callbacks**.
*   **Example**: `onCreate`: An intent arrives in the application, it triggers the creation of an activity.

## Lifecycle and callbacks

(The diagram on Slide 6 visually represents the flow described below.)

The Android Activity lifecycle consists of a series of callback methods that are invoked by the system as an activity transitions through different states.

*   `onCreate()`: Called for the creation of the activity. This is where you should perform basic application startup logic that should happen only once for the entire life of the activity. For example, your implementation of `onCreate()` might call `setContentView()` to define the UI, and might initialize class-scope variables.
*   `onStart()`: Called after the `onCreate()` or `onRestart()` method (precedes the display of the activity view). The activity becomes visible to the user.
*   `onResume()`: Called after the `onStart()` or `onPause()` method (after the activity view is displayed and the activity is in the foreground). The activity starts interacting with the user.
*   `onPause()`: Called when another activity takes over to move to the foreground, or the system is about to destroy the activity. This is typically where you should release resources that should not be held while the activity is not active (e.g., stop animations or other ongoing actions that could consume CPU). It's also the first indication that the user is leaving your activity.
*   `onStop()`: Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. This may happen because it is being destroyed, or because another activity has resumed and is covering it. Allows to free up certain resources.
*   `onRestart()`: Called if the activity returns to the foreground after being stopped (followed by a call to `onStart()`).
*   `onDestroy()`: Called before the activity is destroyed. This can happen either because the activity is finishing (someone called `finish()` on it), or because the system is temporarily destroying this instance of the activity to save space. You can distinguish between these two scenarios with the `isFinishing()` method. Allows to free up the resources linked to the activity.

### Lifecycle Callbacks Code Example:
This Java class demonstrates logging each lifecycle event.

```java
public class CycleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    String msg = "Android : "; // Tag for Log messages

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); // Sets the UI layout
        Log.d(msg, "The onCreate() event");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        Log.d(msg, "The onStart() event");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Log.d(msg, "The onResume() event");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Log.d(msg, "The onPause() event");
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        Log.d(msg, "The onStop() event");
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        Log.d(msg, "The onDestroy() event");
    }

    // onRestart() would also be here in a complete example
    // @Override
    // protected void onRestart() {
    //     super.onRestart();
    //     Log.d(msg, "The onRestart() event");
    // }
}
```

## Saving values from one execution to the next

It is possible to save information from one launch of the application to another (in certain cases such as screen rotation or interruption by another activity), in a `Bundle` object.

We must redefine the `onSaveInstanceState()` method.

**Example**: (Save the int `score`)
```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    // Key for saving and restoring the score
    static final String STATE_SCORE = "playerScore";
    private int score = 0; // value to be saved

    // ... other activity code ...

    @Override
    public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
        // Save the current state (the user's current score)
        outState.putInt(STATE_SCORE, score);

        // Always call the superclass so it can save the view hierarchy state
        super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
        Log.d("MyActivity", "onSaveInstanceState: score saved = " + score);
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Restore state at launch

To restore the state of a variable we must redefine the `onRestoreInstanceState()` method which receives a `Bundle` type parameter. It contains the previously saved state.
Alternatively, the state can also be restored in `onCreate()` as the `Bundle` is passed there as well.

**Example (continued)**: (restore the saved integer)
```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    static final String STATE_SCORE = "playerScore";
    private int score = 0;

    // ... onCreate and other methods ...

    @Override
    protected void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onRestoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState);

        // Restore state members from saved instance
        if (savedInstanceState != null) {
            score = savedInstanceState.getInt(STATE_SCORE);
            Log.d("MyActivity", "onRestoreInstanceState: score restored = " + score);
        }
        // If savedInstanceState is null, it means there's no state to restore,
        // or it's the first time the activity is created.
    }

    // Alternatively, you can restore in onCreate:
    // @Override
    // public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    //     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    //     setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    //
    //     if (savedInstanceState != null) {
    //         score = savedInstanceState.getInt(STATE_SCORE);
    //         Log.d("MyActivity", "onCreate (restore): score restored = " + score);
    //     } else {
    //         // Initialize score if no saved state
    //         score = 0;
    //     }
    //     // ...
    // }
}
```

### Remarks:
*   The `onSaveInstanceState()` method is called whenever there is a chance that the activity will be killed (typically before `onStop()`, often after `onPause()` but not guaranteed). It's called when the system needs to temporarily destroy the activity instance, such as during a configuration change (like screen rotation) or when the system is low on memory.
*   The `onRestoreInstanceState()` method is called after `onStart()` if the activity is being re-initialized from a previously saved state. The `onCreate()` method also receives the same `Bundle` and is another common place to restore state.
