## Android Development Lifecycle

A visual representation of the typical Android development lifecycle:

1.  **Code**: Write or modify the application code.
2.  **Build App**: Compile the code and resources into an application package.
    *   **If successful (yes)**: Proceed to Test.
    *   **If fail**: Return to Code.
3.  **Test**: Run various tests (unit, integration, UI) on the built app.
    *   **If successful (yes)**: Proceed to Signing.
    *   **If fail**: Return to Code.
4.  **Signing**: Digitally sign the application package.
    *   **If successful (yes)**: Proceed to Deploy.
    *   **If fail**: Return to Code (or address signing issues).
5.  **Deploy**: Distribute the signed application (e.g., to Play Store, testers).

## Preliminary steps

*   Generate the application (a file in APK format).
*   The generated application must be signed with a digital signature.
*   Create an account on Play Store and publish the signed APK.

## Android Play Store account creation

*   Creating an Android Play Store account is essential to be able to publish one or more applications.
*   A payment of 25$ is required when creating the account.
*   You only pay this amount once during creation, regardless of the number of published applications.

## Android Package (apk)

*   An Android application generally takes the form of a file with an extension of .apk.
*   This is a simple ZIP archive that contains different elements:
    *   **Classes.dex**: The code for each class in a standard Java application is stored in .class files. In Android, everything is stored in a single file which is `Classes.dex`.
    *   **META-INF**: Contains files related to integrity control of the application and identification of its developer.
    *   **res**: Contains the resources used by the application such as images, sounds, etc.
    *   **jni** and **lib**: Contain the libraries used by the application.

## Structure of an Android application package (apk file)

An APK file typically contains the following structure:

*   **AndroidManifest.xml**: (package name, version, permissions, components, ...)
*   **assets/**: (asset files)
*   **META-INF/**: (signatures)
*   **lib/**: (libs)
*   **classes.dex**: (bytecode)
*   **res/**: (resource files)
*   **resources.arsc**: (compiled resources)

## Why sign APKs?

Applications (APK files) need to be digitally signed so that they can easily be installed on an Android system.
The signature allows you to:

*   Guarantee the integrity of the APK.
*   Identify the author.
*   Guarantee security during application updates.

## Where is the signature?

*   The signature is located within the apk archive, in the directory named **META-INF**.
*   This directory contains the signature and various information about the author of the application.

## Signing the APK

This process is typically done within Android Studio:

1.  **Navigate to "Build" Menu**: In Android Studio, go to `Build` > `Generate Signed Bundle / APK...`.
    *   (The slide shows older UI: `Build` > `Generate Signed APK...`)
2.  **Generate Signed APK Dialog (Initial)**:
    *   If you have an existing key store, provide the:
        *   Key store path
        *   Key store password
        *   Key alias
        *   Key password
    *   If you need to create a new one, click **"Create new..."**.
3.  **New Key Store Dialog** (if "Create new..." was selected):
    *   **Key store path**: Specify the location and filename for your new `.jks` file.
    *   **Password**: Create and confirm a password for the key store.
    *   **Key** section:
        *   **Alias**: Create an alias name for your key.
        *   **Password**: Create and confirm a password for this specific key (can be different from the key store password).
        *   **Validity (years)**: Set the duration for which the key will be valid (e.g., 25 years).
    *   **Certificate** section: Fill in your identification details:
        *   First and Last Name
        *   Organizational Unit
        *   Organization
        *   City or Locality
        *   State or Province
        *   Country Code (XX)
    *   Click **"OK"**.
4.  **Generate Signed APK Dialog (Populated)**:
    *   The fields (Key store path, Key store password, Key alias, Key password) will now be populated with the details of the key store you just created or selected.
    *   Click **"Next"**.
5.  **Generate Signed APK Dialog (Final)**:
    *   **APK Destination Folder**: Specify where the signed APK should be saved.
    *   **Build Type**: Select `release`.
    *   (Product flavors might be listed if configured, but the example shows "No product flavors defined").
    *   Click **"Finish"**.
