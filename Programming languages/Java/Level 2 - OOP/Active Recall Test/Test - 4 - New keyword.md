> [!question] True or False: The `new` keyword in Java is exclusively used for creating instances of user-defined classes and cannot be used for creating arrays of primitive types.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] True or False: When `new` is used to instantiate an object, the memory allocated for the object's attributes is immediately initialized to random values before the constructor is executed.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] Which of the following is the primary function of the `new` keyword in Java, as described in the provided context?
> a) To declare a reference variable for an object.
> b) To allocate memory for an object and invoke its constructor.
> c) To define a new class or interface.
> d) To explicitly destroy an object and free its memory.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) To allocate memory for an object and invoke its constructor.

> [!question] Consider the sequence of events when `new MyClass()` is executed. Which event occurs immediately after the memory zone for the object's attributes is created but before the constructor's custom logic runs?
> a) The object's reference is returned.
> b) The object's attributes are initialized to default values (e.g., 0, `null`, `false`).
> c) The `finalize()` method is called.
> d) The class definition is loaded into memory.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) The object's attributes are initialized to default values (e.g., 0, `null`, `false`).

> [!question] Match the `new` keyword's associated concept with its description.
>> [!example] Group A
>> a) Instantiation
>> b) Reference
>> c) Memory Allocation
>
>> [!example] Group B
>> n) The process of creating an object from a class blueprint.
>> o) The unique identifier or address that points to the newly created object in memory.
>> p) Reserving a contiguous block of memory to store the object's attributes.
>
>> [!success]- Answer
>> a) -> n)
>> b) -> o)
>> c) -> p)
