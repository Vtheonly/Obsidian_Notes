> [!question] True or False: In Java, an object's identity is primarily defined by its memory address, which is directly accessible and modifiable by the programmer.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] True or False: The `java.lang.Object` class is implicitly the superclass of all other Java classes, meaning every class inherits its methods, including `toString()` and `equals()`.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> True

> [!question] Which of the following statements accurately describes the nature of an object in Object-Oriented Programming, according to the provided context?
> a) An object is a passive data structure that is acted upon by independent procedures.
> b) An object is a blueprint or template from which classes are created.
> c) An object is a combination of identity, states (attributes), and behaviors (methods) that interact via message passing.
> d) An object's state is immutable once it has been instantiated.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) An object is a combination of identity, states (attributes), and behaviors (methods) that interact via message passing.

> [!question] When an object is declared in Java (e.g., `MyClass myObject;`), what is its initial state before explicit instantiation with `new`?
> a) Its attributes are initialized to default values (e.g., 0 for numbers, `false` for booleans).
> b) It immediately occupies memory space for its attributes and methods.
> c) It holds a `null` reference, indicating no object has been created yet.
> d) It becomes an instance of `java.lang.Object` by default.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> c) It holds a `null` reference, indicating no object has been created yet.

> [!question] Match the object-related term with its correct description.
>> [!example] Group A
>> a) Instance
>> b) Reference
>> c) State
>
>> [!example] Group B
>> n) The unique memory address or identifier that allows access to an object.
>> o) The specific values of an object's attributes at a given moment.
>> p) A concrete realization of a class, also known as an object or occurrence.
>
>> [!success]- Answer
>> a) -> p)
>> b) -> n)
>> c) -> o)
