> [!question] True or False: Encapsulation in Java primarily aims to prevent any external code from accessing an object's data, even through public methods.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] True or False: The `protected` visibility modifier in Java makes a member accessible only within its own class and to direct subclasses, regardless of package.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> False

> [!question] Which of the following best describes the core principle of encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming, as presented in the course material?
> a) To allow direct access to an object's internal data for maximum flexibility.
> b) To combine static and dynamic aspects of an entity, hiding implementation and controlling access to ensure data integrity.
> c) To enable a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
> d) To define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) To combine static and dynamic aspects of an entity, hiding implementation and controlling access to ensure data integrity.

> [!question] Consider a class member (attribute or method) with default visibility (package-private). From which locations is this member accessible?
> a) Only within its own class.
> b) From anywhere within the same package.
> c) From anywhere within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
> d) From anywhere in the application, regardless of package or inheritance.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> b) From anywhere within the same package.

> [!question] Match the visibility modifier with its scope of access.
>> [!example] Group A
>> a) `private`
>> b) `public`
>> c) `protected`
>
>> [!example] Group B
>> n) Accessible from anywhere within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
>> o) Accessible only within its own class.
>> p) Accessible from anywhere in the application.
>
>> [!success]- Answer
>> a) -> o)
>> b) -> p)
>> c) -> n)
