title: "Memory Management When a C++ Program Ends"

### 1. What Happens to Allocated Memory When a Program Ends?

When you run a C++ program, the operating system (OS) allocates memory for it to use. This memory is typically divided into several segments:

-   **Code/Static Area**: Stores the executable code, global variables, and static variables.
-   **Stack**: Used for local variables, function parameters, and managing function calls. Memory is automatically allocated and deallocated here.
-   **Heap (Free Store)**: A region of memory for dynamic allocation. In C++, you manage this memory using `new` and `delete`.

If you allocate memory on the heap with `new` and forget to release it with `delete`, this is what happens:

-   **During Program Execution**: The memory remains allocated. If this happens repeatedly in a long-running program (like a server or game), it causes a **memory leak**. The program's memory usage will grow over time, potentially leading to poor performance or a crash when the system runs out of memory.

-   **After Program Termination**: When your program terminates (either by finishing its execution or by crashing), the **operating system reclaims all the memory resources** that were assigned to it. This includes all memory on the stack and the heap, even memory that you allocated with `new` but never `delete`d.

In short: **The OS cleans up your mess.** The memory does not remain allocated forever; it is returned to the system for other programs to use.

### 2. What Happens to `new`-Allocated Memory If You Donâ€™t Use `delete`?

When you use the `new` operator in C++, you are requesting memory from the heap. This memory is considered "in use" until you explicitly release it with the `delete` (for single objects) or `delete[]` (for arrays of objects) operator.

If you don't call `delete`:

-   **Destructors Are Not Called**: This is a critical issue in C++. When you `delete` an object, its destructor is called. The destructor is responsible for cleaning up any resources the object owns (e.g., closing files, releasing other memory, closing network connections). If you fail to call `delete`, **the destructor is never run**, and those resources will not be cleaned up properly. This is often a more severe problem than the memory leak itself.

-   **Memory Leaks During Execution**: As mentioned before, in a running program, failing to `delete` memory leads to a memory leak. The program loses its pointer to the allocated memory without freeing it, making that memory unusable for the remainder of the program's life.

-   **Memory is Reclaimed by OS on Exit**: Once the program terminates, the OS reclaims the raw memory. However, this is just a brute-force cleanup. It does **not** gracefully release resources by calling destructors.

### Key Takeaways & Best Practices in C++

1.  **Always `delete` what you `new`**: For every `new`, there must be a corresponding `delete`. For every `new[]`, there must be a corresponding `delete[]`. This is the fundamental rule of manual memory management in C++.

2.  **Resource Leaks are Worse than Memory Leaks**: Forgetting to call `delete` means destructors don't run. This can lead to leaked file handles, database connections, mutex locks, and other system resources, which are often more limited than memory.

3.  **RAII and Smart Pointers**: Modern C++ strongly discourages manual memory management with `new` and `delete`. Instead, we use the **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** idiom, primarily through **smart pointers**:
    -   **`std::unique_ptr`**: Owns an object exclusively. The memory is automatically deallocated when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope. It has almost no overhead compared to a raw pointer.
    -   **`std::shared_ptr`**: Manages an object through shared ownership. The memory is deallocated only when the last `shared_ptr` pointing to it is destroyed.
    -   **`std::weak_ptr`**: A non-owning observer of an object managed by a `shared_ptr`. It's used to break circular dependency issues.

**Example with Smart Pointers:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void use_memory() {
    // No 'new' needed. The unique_ptr manages the memory.
    std::unique_ptr<int> my_int = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    std::cout << *my_int << std::endl;

} // my_int goes out of scope here. Its memory is automatically
  // deleted. No need to call delete!

int main() {
    use_memory();
    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion

While the OS will reclaim memory when your program ends, relying on this is poor practice and indicative of buggy code. In C++, proper memory and resource management is crucial.

-   Failing to `delete` memory causes leaks and prevents destructors from running, which can lead to resource leaks.
-   **The C++ way is to use RAII and smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to automate memory management.** This makes your code safer, cleaner, and free of memory leaks.
