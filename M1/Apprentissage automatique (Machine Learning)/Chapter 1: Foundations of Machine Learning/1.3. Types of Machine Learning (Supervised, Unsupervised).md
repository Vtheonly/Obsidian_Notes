# 1.3 Types of Machine Learning

## Context

Machine learning problems are categorized into several major types based on the nature of the data and the goal of the task. The three primary families are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset where each input `x` is paired with a corresponding correct output or **target `t`**. The model learns to map inputs to outputs with the goal of predicting the target for new, unseen inputs.

* **Classification**: The target `t` belongs to a finite set of discrete categories or classes.

* *Example*: Recognizing handwritten digits (classes are 0-9).

* *Example*: Identifying if an email is spam or not spam (binary classification).

* **Regression**: The target `t` is a continuous, numerical value.

* *Example*: Predicting the price of a house based on its features (size, location).

* *Example*: Forecasting a company's stock value.

## Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without any explicit targets. The goal is to discover hidden structures, patterns, or relationships within the data itself.

* **Clustering (Partitionnement de donn√©es)**: Grouping similar data points together into clusters.

* *Example*: Segmenting customers into different purchasing groups based on their behavior.

* **Density Estimation**: Building a model of the probability distribution that generated the data. This can be used to generate new, realistic data points.

* **Visualization**: Projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D) to be visualized by humans.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an **agent** that learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent performs actions and receives **rewards** or **penalties** in return. The goal is to learn a policy (a strategy for choosing actions) that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. This type is not covered in depth in this context.

| Aspect | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning |

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| **Training Data** | Labeled data (`x`, `t`) | Unlabeled data (`x` only) |

| **Goal** | Predict a target value for a new input | Discover hidden structure in the data |

| **Key Tasks** | Classification, Regression | Clustering, Density Estimation, Dimensionality Reduction |
