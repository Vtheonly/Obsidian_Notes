## Context

To study machine learning effectively, it is essential to understand its core terminology and mathematical notation. This note establishes the consistent language used to describe the components of a machine learning system, from data sets to model predictions.

## Core Components

* **Training Set (`D`)**: A collection of data used to train a model. It consists of multiple *examples*.

* **Example**: A single data point from the training set. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an **input (`x`)** and a corresponding **target (`t`)**.

* **Test Set (`D_test`)**: A separate collection of data used to evaluate the model's performance after training. These data points must not have been used during training.

* **Generalization**: A model's ability to perform accurately on the unseen data in the test set. This is the primary measure of a model's success.

* **Model (`y(x, w)`)**: A function that takes an input `x` and produces a prediction. It is parameterized by a set of weights or parameters (`w`) that are learned during training.

## Summary of Notation

| Symbol | Description |

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `x` | An input vector. Boldface indicates it's a vector containing multiple features. |

| `t` | A target value. Italicized because it is typically a scalar (a single number). |

| `(x_n, t_n)` | The *n*-th training example, consisting of an input vector and its corresponding target. |

| `D` | The entire training set, composed of `N` examples: `{(x_1, t_1), ..., (x_N, t_N)}`. |

| `w` | The vector of model parameters (weights) that are adjusted during training. |

| `y(x, w)` | The model's prediction function. It outputs a predicted value for a given input `x` and a set of parameters `w`. |

> [!Note] Clarification: Example vs. Input

> In machine learning literature, the term "example" or "sample" refers to the entire `(input, target)` pair `(x_n, t_n)`. The input `x_n` alone is just the "input vector" or "feature vector". This distinction is important for clarity.
