Of course. Here is a potential script for each slide, based on the content and your notes, designed for a presentation to beginners.

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**(What to say):**
"Hello everyone, and welcome. Today, we're going to talk about getting started with coding, specifically why web development is the best place to begin.

A common question people have is, 'Why web development over something else, like cybersecurity or data science?' I get that. When I started, I was drawn to cybersecurity, but the more I explored, the more I saw the immense opportunity in other fields.

That's a key lesson in coding: your journey is one of discovery. The more you try, and even the more mistakes you make, the clearer your path becomes. Those mistakes aren't failures; they're just checkpoints showing you where you are.

So today, we'll explore why the web is such a powerful starting point for that journey. And to begin, I'd like to ask you all to think for a moment: Why are *you* personally interested in learning to code?"

### **Slide 2: Why Learn Coding? (Transferable Skills)**

**(What to say):**
"One of the strongest arguments for starting with the web is that the skills are incredibly transferable. When you build a website, you're not just learning to place text on a screen. You're touching on fundamental concepts of networking, user interface design, and even security.

This wide exposure is invaluable. As you tackle these challenges, you'll start to figure out what you truly enjoy. Maybe you'll discover a passion for design and focus on the frontend. Or maybe you'll find you love logic and data, which could lead you to backend development, mobile apps, or even game development. Web development is the launchpad for all of these paths."

### **Slide 3: Why Learn Coding? (Part 2 - Big Projects)**

**(What to say):**
"Look at the biggest names in tech today. Many of them didn't start with a fancy mobile app. They started with a website.

Think about tools you might use every day, like ChatGPT or Gemini. They all began as web applications. This allowed them to test their ideas, gather users, and prove their value before investing in mobile or desktop versions.

The most famous example is Amazon. It started as a simple website selling books. That's it. Decades later, it's a global empire, and one of its biggest products, AWS, literally sells the server infrastructure to host *other people's websites*. That entire journey began with a basic website."

### **Slide 4: Why Learn Coding? (Part 3 - Accessibility)**

**(What to say):**
"Another key advantage is accessibility. When you build a website, it works everywhere, for everyone, instantly. On a phone, a laptop, a tablet, even a smart TV. You build it once, and it's immediately multi-platform.

This is a huge difference from mobile apps, where you need to build and maintain separate versions for iOS and Android, get them approved by app stores, and convince users to download and install them. Websites remove all that friction. There's nothing to install, nothing to update. The user just goes to the address, and it works."

---

### **Slide 5: Why Learn Coding? (Part 4 - Feedback)**

**(What to say):**
"This might be the most important reason for a beginner: the immediate feedback loop. When you're learning to code, motivation is everything.

With many types of software, you have to write a lot of code and then 'compile' it into a single package just to see if it works. Bugs can stay hidden until the very end. But with web development, you make a change in your code, save the file, refresh your browser, and you see the result instantly.

This instant feedback makes learning faster, helps you catch mistakes right away, and gives you that sense of accomplishment that keeps you going. This foundation of quick wins and solid skills is what opens the door to a real career, whether it's freelancing, working for a company, or even building your own startup."

---

### **Slide 6: Why Start with Web Development? (Summary)**

**(What to say):**
"So, to quickly summarize, web development is the ideal starting point because it's **accessible**—all you need is a browser. You get **instant feedback**, which accelerates learning. Your creations are **universal** and can be reached by anyone on any device. And most importantly, it builds a powerful **foundation** for any other tech career you might want to pursue in the future."

### **Slide 7: Web Developer Jobs and Salaries in Algeria**

**(What to say):**
"Let's talk about the practical side: jobs and money. The demand for web developers in Algeria, and globally, is constantly growing. You have options: you can work on the frontend, the backend, or become a full-stack developer who does both.

Now, about the opportunities. You don't need a special license to be a web developer. You can find work on freelance platforms like Upwork and build a client base from all over the world. You can work for local companies, or even better, work remotely for international companies and earn in foreign currency.

Don't listen to people who say 'web development is dead.' They've been saying that for over a decade, and every year, the demand only increases. The field just evolves. Your skills and a good portfolio are your ticket in, and this career path gives you the freedom to work for others or to create your own startup and sell your own solutions."

### **Slide 8 to 27: The Core Concepts**

*(This is a script for the middle section of the presentation, covering the technical basics.)*

**For "What is programming?":** "At its core, programming is just giving a set of instructions to a computer. We use a programming language as the tool to write those instructions. And why are there so many? Because different languages are designed to solve different problems, just like you'd use a hammer for a nail and a wrench for a bolt."

**For "Frontend vs Backend":** "Think of a website like a restaurant. The **frontend** is everything the customer sees and interacts with—the tables, the menu, the decor. The **backend** is the kitchen—it's where the orders are processed, the food is cooked, and all the important work happens behind the scenes."

**For "Frontend (Client-Side)":** "The main languages of the frontend are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They run directly in the user's web browser. Remember: frontend is what the user *sees*."

**For "Backend (Server-Side)":** "The backend is where the logic lives. This is where you handle user accounts, save data to a database, and process information. There are many language choices here, each with trade-offs between things like speed and security."

**For "What Does 'Coding' Mean?":** "So, 'coding' is simply the act of writing these instructions in files. A program, like your browser, then reads these files and displays the final result. It's like writing a document in Word—you type the text, you format it, and the program shows you the finished page."

**For "What Is a Server?":** "So where does this code live? On a **server**. A server is just a powerful computer that's designed to do one thing: stay on 24/7 and 'serve' your website files to anyone who requests them."

**For "Why Can’t Servers Turn Off?":** "It's simple: if the server running your website turns off, your website disappears from the internet. It only exists as long as the server is on and connected."

**For "Intro into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript":** "Now let's look at the three core technologies of the frontend."

**For "What Is HTML?":** "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. But all you need to remember is this: **HTML is the skeleton of your website.** It provides the basic structure and content—it defines what is a heading, what is a paragraph, and what is an image."

**For "Making It Look Good – CSS":** "An HTML skeleton on its own is pretty ugly. That's where CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, comes in. **CSS is the clothing and style.** It's the language we use to add colors, change fonts, set layouts, and make the website look good."

**For "Making It Think – JavaScript":** "Okay, so we have structure from HTML and style from CSS. But how do we make the website interactive? That's the job of JavaScript. **JavaScript is the brain.** It handles logic, actions, and user interactions, like checking if a form is filled out correctly or creating a pop-up window. And to be clear—it has no relation to the language Java!"

### **Slide 30: A Good Roadmap for Beginners (What to Do)**

**(What to say):**
"So, how should you actually start? Here's a simple roadmap.
-   First, focus on the fundamentals: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. With consistent practice, you can get a good grasp of the basics in about a month.
-   Learn the very basics of **GitHub**. Think of it as a way to save and share your code online. You don't need to be an expert.
-   Keep your tools **simple**. All you really need is a code editor like VS Code and a browser like Chrome.
-   **Build small projects.** This is the most important tip. You learn by doing. Don't just watch tutorials; build things, even if they're simple. That's how you truly learn.
-   And finally, **use AI tools wisely**. They are great for explaining a concept or helping you fix a bug, but don't let them write your code for you. The goal is for *you* to learn."

---

### **Slide 31: A Good Roadmap for Beginners (What Not to Do)**

**(What to say):**
"Just as important is knowing what *not* to do.
-   **Don’t start with a massive, complex project.** Your first project should not be a 'Facebook clone.' Start with something you can actually finish. Success builds momentum.
-   **Don't get distracted by advanced design tools** like Figma at this stage. Focus on learning to code.
-   **Stick to one tutorial or course at a time.** Jumping between different resources is confusing and a common trap known as 'tutorial hell.' Pick one and see it through to the end.
-   And finally, **don't overload yourself with unnecessary tools.** Keep it simple and focus on writing code. You can always add more tools later as you need them."
