# Router

## Corrected Context

A **router** is a highly intelligent networking device that forwards data packets **between different networks**. Its fundamental role is to connect separate networks, such as a local home network (LAN) to the internet (a wide area network, or WAN). It serves as the **gateway** for a network.

## How a Router Works

Routers operate using logical **IP (Internet Protocol) addresses** to make decisions.

1.  When a data packet arrives, the router inspects the destination IP address.
2.  It consults its **routing table**—a map of known networks—to determine the best path for the packet.
3.  It then forwards the packet to the next router in the path or to the final device if it's on a directly connected network.

If a router receives a packet with an IP address not intended for its networks, it will reject it, providing a basic layer of security.

## The Default Gateway

For devices on a local network, the router's IP address serves as the **default gateway**. This is the address that hosts use to send any data that is destined for an outside network.
