# Network Hub

## Corrected Context

A **network hub** is a basic, now obsolete, networking device used to connect multiple devices into a single local area network (LAN). It acts as a central connection point but lacks any intelligence for managing data traffic.

## How a Hub Works

A hub is an **unintelligent** device, essentially a **multi-port repeater**. Its operation is inefficient and creates network congestion:

1.  A data packet arrives at one port.
2.  The hub regenerates the signal and **broadcasts** an identical copy to *every other port*.
3.  All connected devices receive the data, even if they are not the intended recipient.

This "glorified splitter" approach means all devices on the hub share the same bandwidth and must process unnecessary traffic.

## Key Points

*   Unintelligent device
*   Broadcasts all data
*   Multi-port repeater
*   Creates network congestion
*   Causes security vulnerabilities
*   Largely obsolete

> [!Warning] Performance and Security Issues
> Hubs create significant problems:
> 1.  **Security Risks:** Since every packet is sent to every device, data can be easily intercepted.
> 2.  **Wasted Bandwidth:** Broadcasting creates unnecessary network traffic, consuming bandwidth and slowing down the entire network.
