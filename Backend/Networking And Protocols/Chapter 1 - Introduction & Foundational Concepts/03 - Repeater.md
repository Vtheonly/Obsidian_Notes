# Repeater

## Corrected Context

A **repeater** is a simple network device whose sole purpose is to regenerate and retransmit a signal. Network signals naturally decay over long distances, and a repeater boosts the signal back to its original strength to extend the range of the network.

## How It Works

A repeater operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It does not analyze the data within the signal; it simply cleans, amplifies, and re-broadcasts it.

This allows two devices to communicate over a distance that would otherwise be too great for the signal to travel reliably.

## Key Points

*   Regenerates signals
*   Extends network distance
*   Overcomes signal decay
*   Operates at Layer 1
*   No data filtering

> A [[04 - Network Hub|Network Hub]] is functionally a **multi-port repeater**. It takes an incoming signal and regenerates it out of all its other ports.
