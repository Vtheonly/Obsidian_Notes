# Modem

## Corrected Context

A **Modem** (Modulator-Demodulator) is the essential device that connects your home network to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It translates the digital signals from your computer into analog signals suitable for transmission over the ISP's infrastructure (such as cable, fiber, or phone lines) and vice versa.

## Core Function

> The modem acts as the **interpreter** between your local network and the wider internet. Without it, your router and other devices cannot understand the signal coming from your ISP.

For a single wired computer, a modem is often the only device needed to get online. However, to connect multiple devices or use Wi-Fi, a router is required to create a local network.
