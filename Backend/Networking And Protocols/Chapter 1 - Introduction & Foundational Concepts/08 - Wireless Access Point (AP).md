# Wireless Access Point (AP)

## Corrected Context

A **Wireless Access Point (AP)** is a networking device that allows Wi-Fi-enabled devices to connect to a wired network. It acts as a central transmitter and receiver of wireless radio signals.

## Function

An AP converts data from the wired Ethernet network into wireless signals and broadcasts them. It also does the reverse, receiving wireless signals from devices and converting them back into wired signals.

While an AP can be a standalone device (common in offices, hotels, and airports), its functionality is most commonly integrated into the **all-in-one wireless routers** used in homes. It is the component that actually "creates" the Wi-Fi network.
