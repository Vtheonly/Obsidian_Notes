00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Hello everyone, 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.840
I welcome you all to this wonderful
course on computer networks.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.280
I am your instructor here

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.780
to take you throughout this
journey on computer networks.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.640
Before we start,
let's figure out

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.200
to whom this course
is actually intended to.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.160
This course is mainly for
the undergraduate students.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.520
And this course is
useful for the students

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.480
who are preparing for
their GATE exams.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.680
And not only GATE exams,
this course will surely help

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.480
the students to crack
networking based interviews.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.460
This course can be
a prerequisite course

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.360
to CCNA international
certification course.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.520
And if you want to demystify all
the networking technologies

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.460
and jargons used in
the networking field,     

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.020
this course will surely
fulfill your expectation.               

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.060
In a nutshell, this course
will surely quench

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.800
the thirst of
computer networking.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.400
And coming to the
scope of this course,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.060
trust me guys, networking
is everywhere.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.460
Because network supports
the way we learn,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.640
network supports the
way we communicate,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.620
network supports the way we work
and the way we play.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.980
I shall explain you how
network supports the way we learn.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.000
I am the instructor
of this course

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.080
and I am teaching in
one part of the world.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380
And the learners are in
different parts of the world.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.160
Still teaching and learning is
happening very seamlessly.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.000
That's the power of networking.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.620
Network supports the way we communicate.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.400
Think of a traditional
land-line phone communication.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.120
We used to send only
our voice data, but now

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.780
the communication pattern
has entirely changed.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.500
Think of an example
mobile application Whatsapp.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.860
We are able to send text, images,
animations, videos, audios,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.220
and even voice calls and video calls
which are real time communication.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.720
We are able to do all this
communication seamlessly

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.300
and perfectly with the
help of computer networks.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.520
Isn't the computer network awesome guys?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.200
Network supports the way we work.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Yes, one can work from home by
accessing the files and softwares

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
actually available
in the company.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.460
And network supports the way we play too.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.380
Talking about the pedagogy,
we need to understand

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740
the theoretical background
of all the concepts.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.260
Hence we go with the
traditional lecturing methods

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
and the contemporary
lecturing methods.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.700
As I already mentioned to you
that we will be solving

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.120
many GATE examination related
problems here in this course.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.460
And to understand
the things practically,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.760
world's one of the most powerful
simulation and learning tools,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.600
the CISCO packet
tracer is used.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.760
And talking about the syllabi, in the first 
phase of the computer networking course

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.300
the fundamentals are
dealt elaborately.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.420
Actually computer
networks follows layering

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.760
to send data from
one computer to another

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.540
and each layer is addressed
separately as a separate chapters

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.940
and it is dealt in a
very detailed manner.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.540
And security is very
important not only in real life

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.260
even for computer
networks too.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.540
And in the last phase of
the computer networks

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.680
will cover the
need for security

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.820
and how security is provided
in computer networks.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.560
Now let's talk about the
outcomes of today's lecture.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.700
Upon the completion of this lecture,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.640
the learner will be
able to understand

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.960
What is computer network?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.820
and they will be able to
identify end devices

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.600
and intermediary devices
if the scenario is given.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.980
We will start with the definition
of a computer network.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.820
A computer network is a set of nodes
connected by communication links.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.220
I repeat -- A computer
network is a set of nodes

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920
connected by
communication links.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.480
To understand this definition,
I shall highlight the important words.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.560
They are the keywords
of this definition.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.920
The keywords are - nodes
and communication links.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.060
Firstly, we will concentrate on nodes.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.240
A node can be a computer,
printer or any other device

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.320
capable of sending or receiving data.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.700
Say you have a device, if that device
can send data or receive data

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
or both send and
receive data,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.220
then we can call that
device as a node.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.220
So a node can be a computer,
printer or any device

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.920
but the important point
to note here is that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.440
device should be capable enough
in sending or receiving the data.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.380
We shall see some
examples for nodes.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.080
Obviously, a computer
is a node because

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.000
a computer can send data
as well as receive data.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.920
A server, printer,
security camera

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.480
and many devices like
switches, bridges

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.400
and routers are also
called as nodes.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.440
We will be dealing
about switches,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.680
bridges and routers in
the upcoming lectures.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.800
Now we are done with nodes.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680
We will concentrate on
what are communication links.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.580
A communication link can be
a wired link or a wireless link. 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.800
The important point to
note about a link is that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.580
this link only carries the information.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.920
If you don't understand
anything out of this,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.460
just wait for
this example.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.920
See this example now,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.520
there are two
computers.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.920
We can call these two computers as nodes.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.100
Why? Because these
two computers

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.260
can send data as
well as receive data.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.360
Now these nodes are going to
exchange their information,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280
but for exchanging
the information,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.040
they are depending upon this cable.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.680
Here this cable
is the link.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.600
Obviously, a cable is
a physical medium,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.660
so it comes under
wired category.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.320
So wired link carries
the information

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.400
from this computer to this
computer or vice-versa.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.440
But there are scenarios where,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.180
two devices wants to
communicate with each other

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.900
but not with the
help of cables.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.900
Say in this scenario, these two
smart-phones wants to exchange data.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.940
Say, this phone wants to
give some data to this phone.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.520
In this case there is
no physical connectivity.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.280
Then how can that
communication be established?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.000
This is possible through
wireless technologies,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.160
if that is the case, who is
going to carry the signals?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.020
Obviously, air is going
to carry the data.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.780
So here, air is
the link that

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.900
carries the data from
one place to another place.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.300
So we have two kinds
of communication links

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.080
one is a wired link and
another one is a wireless link.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.220
And the link only
carries the information.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.560
We shall see some examples.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.580
Cable is a best example for wired link

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.900
and air is the best example for wireless link.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.480
Now let's take this
example, where this example

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.340
involves lots of nodes
and so many links.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.420
If you observe, certain
links are wired links

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.480
and certain links
are wireless links.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.100
So this is a perfect example of
a sample computer network.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.620
Now what are all the devices
or nodes involved in the network?

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.260
This printer is a node,
desktop computers are nodes,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.420
tablet is a node,
this smart-phone is a node,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.720
cellphone tower is a node,
this wireless router is a node,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.660
router, internet cloud, et cetera.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.440
See there are lots of nodes
involved in this internet cloud.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.480
In reality, internet contains lots of intermediary devices,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.440
these all are intermediary devices
and these all are end devices.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.440
Why we call this as end device?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.980
Because this will be either the
starting point of the communication

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.080
or the end point in
the communication.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.440
Say for example, if this computer wants
to access www.nesoacademy.org,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.020
so here, the link between this computer
and this device- this switch is the wired link.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.840
But communication can happen
through this intermediary devices.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.940
Similarly, if this
smart-phone also wants

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.300
to get some data
from nesoacademy.org,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.000
this can also give the
request but this request

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.680
can be carried out either
this way or this way.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.580
But if you observe both in the ways, they are wireless.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.100
So the same server can be
accessed with the help of wires

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.960
as well as with the
help of wireless.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.920
Now, the important point to note
about a computer network

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.580
is that, it is mainly used
for resource sharing.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.260
A computer network is mainly
used for resource sharing.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.200
Say, there are four
computers here,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.940
if all four computers
wants a printer,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.420
it is definitely not an
ideal solution to purchase

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.060
four printers for
all computers.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.180
Think of the scenario this way,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.620
I have brought
in a printer

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.020
and connected this
printer to my network.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.080
Now all these four computers
can use this printer.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.920
So thus, networks save a
lot of infrastructure cost as well.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.560
And there is an interesting
scenario for you.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.940
You have to find out

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.520
what are all the end devices
used in the scenario

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.800
and what are the
intermediary devices.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.160
After finding out all the end
devices and the intermediary devices,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.680
just list out like this
on your paper.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.260
So I am showing this
scenario for you.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.600
Please take a piece of
paper and note down

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.360
all the end devices and
intermediary devices.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.500
Please pause this video for
a while and carry out this task.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.180
Once done, you compare
this with the actual result.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.800
Now if your result is
matching with this result,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.260
congratulations to you.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.520
You are progressing
in a right direction.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.000
If not, no problem guys.
We are in the initial stage,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.520
it will take some lectures

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.940
to understand the
details about networking.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.160
Upon the completion
of this lecture,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160
the learner will be
able to understand

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.600
what is computer network?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.420
And given a scenario, the learner
will be able to identify

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.740
what are end devices and
what are intermediary devices.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.800
I hope you are all very clear with
the definition of a computer network.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.280
It is a set of nodes connected
by communication links,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.540
