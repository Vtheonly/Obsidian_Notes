# API Development

Laravel is a great choice for building robust and scalable APIs. You can easily create API routes in the `routes/api.php` file and use Laravel's built-in features to handle authentication, data transformation, and more.

## API Resources

API resources allow you to transform your models and model collections into JSON.

```php
// app/Http/Resources/UserResource.php

public function toArray($request)
{
    return [
        'id' => $this->id,
        'name' => $this->name,
        'email' => $this->email,
        'created_at' => $this->created_at,
        'updated_at' => $this->updated_at,
    ];
}
```

## Authentication

Laravel provides two packages for API authentication:

*   **Sanctum:** A lightweight authentication system for SPAs (single-page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token-based APIs.
*   **Passport:** A full OAuth2 server implementation.

The choice of which package to use will depend on the needs of your application.
