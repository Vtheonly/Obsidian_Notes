# What is Laravel?

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework created by Taylor Otwell. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is known for its elegant syntax, robust features, and developer-friendly environment. Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for developers without sacrificing application functionality.

## History and Philosophy

Laravel was first released in 2011. Taylor Otwell created Laravel as an attempt to provide a more advanced alternative to the CodeIgniter framework, which did not provide certain features such as built-in support for user authentication and authorization.

Laravel's philosophy is centered around the idea that "happy developers make the best code." This is reflected in the framework's design, which prioritizes simplicity, elegance, and readability.
