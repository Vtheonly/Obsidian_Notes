hey what's up everybody uh my name is Caleb from Caleb theaker 2 Caleb curry.com uh this video will be your introduction to database design we're pretty much going to cover a lot of a lot of everything so this is going to be a great series if you're just starting out or if you want to get a broad overview of everything then yeah stick with this if you want to know more about the series check out my introduction otherwise let's get rolling so database design before we talk about about database design let's first talk about a database because we can't design a database if we don't know what a database is that doesn't even make sense so what is a database that's a really good question I'm glad you asked well I can actually tell you what a database is and that's what this video is about so a database is something that stores data all right another vague term data and I want you to guys I want all of you to think about data very broadly don't think too specific think of data as anything we can store in a database or anything we can write down anything that has a value it can be anything data can be the list of every single customer of your store since 1995 or it can be a list of every single transaction in a online shopping center or it can be be a list of every user and their username or it could be a list of every single weather event since 1927 it can be pretty much anything it doesn't have to do with specific people data is so broad so database is obviously broad too because a database stores data so yeah just think of it like this here we have a database a base is where we store data pretty simple all right so now that's pretty vague and I'm not sure if that was very helpful so now let's break it down to where we see it from a technical standpoint everything in this world not everything but almost everything is ran from a backend database it's what stores all of our information so for example I like to use websites for examples because they're very clear and they're very easy to understand the concept of this when you go to a website and you sign up you you give them a username you give them a password and you give them an email all of that when you sign in the next time it allows you to sign in well how did that website remember what your username email and password was that's because all of this information that you put in when you registered well all of these values are given to a database so here you can say is our database sorry for my craptastic hand rating but don't don't even worry about it this is what's said to be the front end this is said to be the back end that's because we don't necessarily see what's going on back here we can put in our email our username and our password and it can get stored in this database that way when we come back again and we log in we give them a username and a password it takes that value it checks it with the database to allow you to get into the account that is a perfect example of a database so a database can store that information but it's not limited to only registration you can use this to store all of your records of sales in a store and all so forth it just goes on don't think of it as a limited thing because there's so many things you can do with a database so many things next question you may be asking is how does it differ from like a spreadsheet for example so a spreadsheet basically if you don't really know much about spreadsheets it's basically where you have columns and then we have rows and we can store information about like we can enter the values for each column spreadsheets are good if that's what you need if you're a very small company excuse me but if you want to get to any complexity where you can like imagine if we wanted to select let's say this was a spreadsheet for all of my employees I own a huge business with 100 employees and I want to select every single employee who has missed less than three days and have been a an employee for at least three years and I want to give them a $100 bonus well that's something if I had a spreadsheet I'd have to manually go through that check every single value that's not going to work because that times money in business but anyways with a database we can run queries to get those kind of values to figure out which employees have been a member a employee for three years and have only missed three days or less so that's how it difference from a spreadsheet basically what you can do with it if you have a spreadsheet with 10 employees or like I'm sorry with 10 values and that's like you can figure out all of your information in a couple of seconds well then you might not need a database that's up to you the other thing is with with uh spreadsheets it's it's um it's either like all data or no data let's say I just this stored every single detail about every single employee that I had and all I wanted was their name and their address well we can't really do that easily with a spreadsheet unless we take all those columns and like copy and paste and all this extra garbage or find some algorithm to do things fancily if you know what you're doing you can probably do it but with a database we can selectively choose which column so we can say only these two columns do we want returned and we can ignore the rest on top of that we can allow different users to access different information back to the website example we had users page and then we had a database when here you put your username email and password that's stored on a database but that's not necessarily the only thing that's stored on a database a user might only get to access that but a database administrator might get to access when they registered the transactions they've made on your shopping website or what they've watched what what they've viewed uh the comments they've made how often they visit the web page it's pretty much Limitless to what you want to do with the database so we can see that two different users this person only gets to view some things of the database this person can only can view pretty much anything with the spreadsheet it's kind of All or Nothing do you have access to the spread sheet yes I do well here it is if you don't have access well then too bad you don't get any of it so that that's awesome that's a security feature as well because you don't want this person to get all of the hidden information that's stored within this database so hopefully that makes things pretty darn clear uh the next video I'll kind of be talking about how data is stored in a database because I didn't I was going to get into that in this video but I kind of ran out of time but for the sake of just your understanding if you decide not to watch the second video which you will watch the second video right relations that's a term where we get the term relational database so uh this series is for what's known as a relational database that is a specific kind of database and that's going to be most of the relation that's going to be most of the databases that you work with if you're working with database design so in the next video we will be getting into what relational means and why it's useful why is why is it a good database system why do we need a relational database that's what we'll be talking about so so thank you guys for watching and be sure to subscribe and click like on this video and I will see you guys in the next one peace out
