hey everyone thank you for sticking with me this far uh in this video I just want to do a little bit of review as well as go over the vocabulary that we've learned so if you don't really want to know we're going to go over some new ones too but uh if you don't want to review then feel free to skip this video in the next one so this video will be about data and uh database design terms so the very first term we learned was Data data is pretty much anything we store in a database you pretty much know what that is so that one's pretty good database that is what we store our data in and then we have a specific kind of database which is a relational database and what's special about a relational database is that it stores things in tables uh we have a database management system or database manage dbms for short that is how we manage a database using code that's how we uh control our database we have a specific kind of database management system called a relational database management system which is just used to uh control our tables and the values within our tables of a relational database pretty simp simple now we're going to introduce a new word to you which is null or null however you want to pronounce it I've been told I pronounce it wrong but I don't really care anyways this is when someone does not enter a value within a column on a table so if we have a table and we have something such as fax number well not everyone is going to have a fax number so when we have a guy let's say we have an ID here we have an a guy with the idea of seven and we don't have a fax number this Emptiness is said to be null uh so basically uh you'll hear empty value although by definition null means no value so it's kind of a bad definition but who cares null basically means there is no data in that uh specific field and we'll be getting into more terms like that in a second so that is what N means that's one you will need to know uh another one is an anomaly or anomalies so anomalies are basically errors with within our data in our data Integrity so when we have an anomaly it's something that goes away from what we expect or from the normal when we update something for example and instead of updating one column it updates 10 and it wasn't supposed to that's an anomaly so yeah you'll need to know that as well uh the other one is integrity we Implement database Integrity to protect against anomalies so we we went over three different kinds of Integrity we went over entity Integrity we went over referential and we went over domain real quick what these are entity Integrity is saying uniqueness among the table referential keeps the connections the keys foreign Keys primary keys they keep them connected across cross multiple tables so we could say these two tables have some kind of connection and then domain is basically saying a column within a table has all of the expected values so we have a phone number we would expect numbers not text or not a date that is domain integrity and the word domain is basically the range of values that are acceptable to store within a column so these are our data vocabulary that you should know now we're going to move on into the design terms yay so designing is what we're here for so this is fun very first thing you need to know is an entity which is anything we store data about a user a um a a mortgage a transaction a credit card information anything the comments a comment they're all entities that's what we're storing data about then we have attributes attributes are the things we store about the entity a comment a uh an attribute of a comment would be the date that it was made the length how how many characters is it who posted it that's an example of an attribute a relation if we're talking about mathematics it's a connection between two sets of data when we're talking about databasing put very simply it's just a table so a relation is another name for a table where we have data within our database so we could we can have a structure of different tables so these can be connected just I don't know however you want to connect them this can be our database well each one of these different sets of C uh different sets of information or data is known as a relation it's a table next term is a tupple however you want to pronounce that too just a wing in it here that's another thing for a row it's a it's all of the attributes about a specific entity so if we have this guy we can say his name is Caleb his phone number is blah blah blah blah blah his address his uh age his or his birth date would probably be better uh how long he's been a member of this website or whatever it is this all of these values about this entity that's what that is a tle that would also be a row on a table because we physically represent relations with a table so when we have a table we have the columns so we'd have name phone number address social security number and then when we enter all of those for a specific person we have the ID of seven the name Caleb the phone number blah blah blah the address blah blah blah that is known as a tupple or a row um another term is a table which we just talked about that which is just a physical represent representation of a relation tables are what we store in a database to organize am I like cutting my head off there can't really see to organize our data within a table we have rows and we have columns the rows would be a specific individual entry within our our table so like that guy we just drew all of his values would be his Row The Columns are that specific and a specific attribute of that person such as a name this is the column where we would put the value Caleb all right now we also have another three three more terms that we haven't learned yet which you will possibly hear they're kind of older terms but they they're just talking about the same thing you may hear the terms file uh record and then field so what are these talking about well file it's just another name for a table a record is another name for a row and a field is another uh term for a column so other than that we have the the words value a value is the information that we put in to a specific column so here is a value Caleb or subscribe or let me get r or 700 or June 16th whatever it is those are all values all right oh man it's already 10 minutes dang all right then we have an entry you may hear the term entry which I like to use this for the like the it's almost like a verb uh the when you enter data you get an entry so basically an entry is just another name for a row so I'm there's obviously a lot of similar names and we'll be making a table saying what word just just give me a minute database design the process of designing your table to remove anomalies and have data Integrity schema or schema however you want to pronounce that that is just a physical that's just a um drawn out structure of our our database then we have a new term here it's called normalize or normalization normalization is basically just a bunch of steps that we're going to follow to help us get the best database designed so that's just that's part of database design when we go through these normal forms to get the best database Bas design we'll talk about that more in an upcoming video but just I want you to know that the term normalization is the process of building the best database design uh the other one naming conventions a naming convention is just a consistency used to make things consistent so we name tables a certain way we name columns a certain way we name our database a certain way we draw our database schema a certain way so basically convention is anything that is done repeatedly to create consistency and the last one here is uh Keys which I'm not sure if I talked about this or not yet I think a little bit but not much a key is something to make everything unique within a table this is how we make connections among tables we connect IDs we may say oh this this comment was posted by the user with the ID of seven well that points back to the user table we do all of that with keys and we'll learn more about those as time goes on all right so you see we have a lot of terms and a lot of them are repeats for this meaning the same thing for example we have a relation and then we have table and then we have file so relation table and file are all talking about the physical structure a table pretty much record I'm going to circle these ones a record would be a row so we have a row and then we have a tle these are all talking about rows within a table and then we have um how should I do this let's just Let's cross them out we have columns and then we have attributes and then we have a field those are all talking about a column in a table of and also entry you can kind of think of that as a a row because you put like you enter data into the table and you get a new row a value is just a specific you can think of it like I'm going erase some of this we have this table and we break it up into columns so we have I ke name and then phone number for example those are a column headers and then we have specific values seven Caleb da da da da and then we have another guy eight well if we separate this into cells which is another term we uh have a specific value that we put in here such as a John that is a value now entity that's the only one that's uh so we just just went over value entity is what's left that's not circled or crossed out or squared or something entity is I don't like to really assign this to like a row or a table or anything because an entity is just something we're storing data about so that could be an individual row or it could be the table type so for example we have a table for users well the user is the entity but a specific a specific entity would be a row within this table because we'd have the entity for uh this guy over here and then we have one for this guy down here or for this chick over here or lady I should say so these all get their own rows do you see so an entity that's just something restore dat about so yeah I know that was super long and hopefully that was helpful and if I just was rambling on I'm sorry but I'll see you in the next video be sure to subscribe
