hello world in this video we're going to be talking about a new topic known as cardinality at least I believe that's how it's pronounced but if it's not don't don't judge me all right so I'll write that out for you we actually talked about this a little bit but we haven't really designed it or anything because now we're talking about actually drawing out databases cardinality is basically the relationship type between a row of one table and rows or a row of another table so I thought of a the best example I have for this is a credit card database so like basically a credit card company has a table for credit cards and then a table for card holders or the people who uh order the credit cards and use them to buy things and basically they're the credit card company's customers I guess so I will draw those tables out just so you can see this I'm not going to draw them real big or anything but just so you see how the next work so we have the card holder and then over here we have the card and there's some kind of relationship between here between these two tables now the only two possibilities for cardinality are one or many obviously for both sides so you can have one to many one to many or many to many those are the only three possibilities now another thing to think about when it comes to many to many that might even you might even consider that as not a possibility because you'd have to have an intermediary table which we talked about that when we talked about designing many to many relationships when when we're talking about many to many relationships here it's logical which which uh what I mean by that is we're we're drawing it as a just like this and we would say many of too many and then when we actually Implement that in a database we would have to have a card holder uh card holding table and then the cards table that would be how to draw a many to many relationship so hopefully that kind of makes sense uh for that so in reality when you're actually drawing out finalized products of databases the only possibilities are one to many or one to many cu even if you have an intermediary table this is going to be a one to many relationship and then a one to many relationship and there's certain way to draw those out that's what I'm going to be uh drawing right now so at one to many it's pretty simple the one side all you have is a straight up and down line like this the many side you have this this uh thing that we're doing right now is known as Crow Foot notation because it looks like Crow Foot I think that's why they call it that I don't really know but this is a one this is a many so when we're drawing it one many we could also have one to one of course so that's another possibility I forgot to mention one to one now before we start drawing it on both sides I think it's easy just to think about one side like think of a card holder relationship to a card we would have one card holder now that we have that side figured out we got we just think about the card holder then we can add in the card and we have many cards so one card holder can have many cards and that's how you would design the line between the tables like that now there's another thing we need to talk about known as modality which we'll talk about in the next video but for this we're just going to keep it simple just drawing these things here but you might see also like circles you might see a circle here for example uh we'll talk about that in the next video so now you know how to draw a one to many relationship so what does this exactly mean that means one row can be connected with many rows in this table it's not necessarily the table but the rows within the table so we could think of a specific card holder we could have a card holder with the name Jack an ID of two and we could have many rows over here of cards we have a card with the ID of id6 id8 ID 12 and you can see this guy has a lot of credit cards so all of these rows can be connected to an individual row within the card holder table now let's look at it the other way we could have a many to one relationship or basically a one to many going the other direction so we could have this so now one card can be connected to multiple people but multiple people can't be connected to one card I'm sorry one card can be connected to multiple people but one card holder can only be connected to one card so that means one person cannot own more than one card so now we think of it the other way around we have a card uh with the ID three we have a card with the ID four the ID of uh six it doesn't really matter what the numbers are and then we have a card holder we just got got a guy named Jack which ID of three and then we got [Music] Bill ID of two well we have we can have one card attached to many people so this card could be attached to many people which means these people co-own a card they're both the owner of one card but now you have to realize an individual card holder can't be connected to uh multiple cards so Jack cannot own another card that's not going to work out if you wanted that to work out then you'd have to have the intermediary table which we talked about in designing many to many relationships and this this video is less of to be a review of relationships but more of how to draw them so you have to realize the difference between all of these possibilities one to one um one to many or one to many it just depends on the actual application all right so thank you guys for watching uh sorry if that was if I kept stuttering this is the first time I made a video in a couple weeks so you know first started I first start making videos and I I like stutter and I can't get things together but next video will be awesome so yeah catch you there
