hey what's up welcome to your third normal form so third normal form in order to get there you have to first do first normal form and second normal form so it's kind of like a ladder you can't just start at third normal form you have to work your way up there so this one deals with what's known as a transitive dependency which is when a column depends upon a column which depends upon the primary key so I know that's kind of like confusing so let me just kind of draw it out in a table make a lot more sense so here we have a review table as you can see I'm kidding you can't see it's just a square so we could say review so like this could be on a website it could be you know like a a shopping website where you review a product or it can be a review on a video or anything really it could be a review on a book most likely it to be on a shopping website where you buy something whether it be a book or anything or car s or whatever it doesn't matter but in this you would have something like a review ID obviously which will be the uh primary key you would also likely have what that review is like in a text form so like a comment so you would have the actual review and then you would have maybe a star rating or multiple star ratings so you could have a star rating so maybe 1 through five one being the worst five being awesome and then four maybe being like really sort of okay you know and then we might have something that has a star uh star meaning so that would be like a sort of okay right and finally we might have something like either a user or the poster I'll just put the user because likely you will have some kind of user account on this website where you can post comments so this will likely be a user ID and it will be a foreign key to a user table but we're not going to put that in here right now because that's unrelated to the actual point so foreign key primary key now let's look at right here we have an issue this is what's known as a transitive dependency cuz the star meaning depends upon the star and a way you can kind of try to figure out if it depends on it is okay well if we change the star is the star meaning going to change well if we take the star and we change it from a four to a three it might go from it might go from really super okay to really average so the star meaning is going to change so that's a dependency but then the star actually depends upon the actual review ID because if you change the actual review the star is able to change so this is known as a transitive dependency and it is bad now you can also have a multiple transitive dependency which I don't even know what those are called but that would be where a column depends upon a column which depends upon a column which depends upon a column which depends upon the actual primary key it didn't can go on forever for as long as you want but you don't want it because it's bad which is why we're going to remove it so to remove this you take the columns that are causing a problem you remove them to a separate table and then you create a forign key in replace of them which references the actual other column so let's do this so since these columns right here are the ones causing the main problem we take them we put them in their own table we have a star table within the star table we're going to have a star idid and then we're going to have the actual star whether it be one two 3 four five or whatever kind of rating system you're using and then we're going to have the star meaning and then over here we're going to replace these columns let me make this a little prettier and I just made it five times worse but we're going to replace that with a star ID which is going to reference this table over here so now we don't have that problem because the only column over here is star ID we don't have the star meaning which was the real column that was causing the problem now over here we could have if we drew out this table we would have you know we could have a star ID of three and that star could be a a three star rating and it could be meaning it could mean a average now we're likely to only have five individual rows in this table so it's kind of like a reference table so over here we could have a star ID of 1 2 3 4 5 or 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 6 7 8 n it doesn't really matter what the ID is because the ID is just a number used by the database and has no real world value so we would have five rows in here and then we would reference them in the reviews table so we could have okay this is too ugly let's let me just explain it we could have one review with the star rating ID of five which could correlate to a certain rating from this ratings table that's the main idea of the third normal form is to take those transitive dependencies move them to a new table create a foreign key to to reference that table so in review first normal form is making everything Atomic second normal form is removing any partial dependencies and then third normal form is removing any transitive dependencies so thank you guys for watching I'll catch you in the next video where we're going over something awesome peace
