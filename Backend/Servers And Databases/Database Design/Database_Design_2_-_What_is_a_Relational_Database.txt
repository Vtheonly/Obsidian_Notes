hey what's up everyone welcome back to your second database design Series this video we're going to be talking about the relation very basic don't freak out but it is math we're not going to go super in- depth with math if you want to know more about the math I have blogs on my website about that Caleb curry.com blogs advertising not blogs advertising I was advertising anyways basically a relation is just a connection between data so let's just think of silly example if we had the two sets of numbers two four and then the other set was 68 and then we kind of combined these sets so we kind of like crossed here and then we cross down here and where these cross is our new set so we have the combined set of 62 and then we have the combined set of 64 and then we have the combined set of 82 and then the combined set of 84 and like you're probably wondering like what the heck does that have to do with database design well somewhat we kind of do the same thing with database design relation in relational database comes from this mathematical concept but rather than combining sets of numbers we're combining um attributes of real world things so let's apply this to the database first you need to know two terms the first one is an entity the second one is an attribute so an entity is anything we store data about attribute are the things that we store so if an entity is a person an attribute would be their name their uh username their password their hair color their address their phone number their relationship status the person they're in a relationship with the orders that they've made or whatever whatever it is it's depends on what you need to store for that specific application so entity is what we store the data about attribute is what we store when we apply this to this this uh connection with the the the relation we have the attribute types and the attribute values so let's say we have this person over here and we'll name him Caleb because that's an awesome name all right and then we will also give him a username uh Caleb curry with no spaces and we'll give him a password pi12 3 and then over here we have the set of attributes for a table we have name username and password we can make this connection of data so the name is Caleb the username Caleb Curry password is pi1 123 that makes sense although graphically it looks like a mess so we store these in tables which is exactly what we were doing with the relations so we have a here in our columns we have uh we have the name and then we have the username and then the password don't worry if you can't read my handwriting you you you get it we store this in a table right so these are the things we need to connect with this person over here which we named Caleb and I accidentally erased them whatever we'll just leave it at that so that's Caleb and we want to store this information in this table which is a graphical way to to illustrate how we're storing data in a database so we take his name Caleb we take his username Caleb Curry we take his password pi1 123 we kind of get this this table concept it almost looks like a uh spreadsheet that we talked about in the last video although it is slightly different and we'll be talking about that as time goes on this guy is the entity that we're storing information about these are the attributes that we need to store about this person or any other person so we enter specific values for each one of these attributes to make the relation between the attributes and the entity hopefully that makes kind somewhat sense and if it doesn't don't freak out this all kind I mean this is complex thought and you don't necessarily need to understand every single detail to design a database so I'm just trying to explain things and we'll get through it these are the attributes of this person this entity an entity is basically just anything we store data about it's something can be a person in this case but it can also be an order it can be a uh a customer it can be a client it can be a employee an employer whatever it is it doesn't even have to be a person so now the relation idea you kind of understand that we're just making the connection between the attributes and the entity the value the The Entity attributes where entering that in the database that's that's kind of a weak explanation but honestly it doesn't really matter that much for getting into basic database design so if you want to learn more about that just look up relation and database design you'll figure it out so now we have the entity over here and then we have the attributes so in table terms terms you probably know rows and columns you might not know specifically what they are and I'm going to tell you this right here is a row can you see that might be running out of space here I think we're good yeah we're good so this all of these values are a row so a row is all of the attribute values for a specific entity so this row it'd be easier just to go like this this row points to that entity that person pretty simple a column are all of the values for a specific attribute type so the attribute type is username we could have another person Billy Joe and his name his password can be pizza with a u and his name can be bill this is another person in our table so this is talking about a different person we have this person over here this see is pretty chill well this row is talking about this entity the username is a colum where we have all of the attribute types username so Kay C Curry Billy Joe and whatever more if we put more values into the table okay so this is getting a little messy so I'm just going to clean it up a bit erased so just to summarize a bit we have very first thing we have an entity type that's that's a word you want to know entity type which we talked about entities I'll just I'll just tell you what an entity type is in just a sec entity type and then we have the attribute type so basically the type means it's a category so the person was a specific entity the C the guy who's named Caleb that was an entity it was the person then we also had the entity uh Joe or Billy or whatever his name was those were two separate people two separate entities although you could tell that they were somewhat similar they were both in the same table they were both uh talking about the username password and so forth so the entity type is user a specific entity would be Caleb or Bill or Jamie or Jake or whoever it is so the entity type is basically the category of The Entity that we're storing the category is a user and all the all the entities within it should be a user so my camera stopped recording by itself for some reason which is super annoying but anyways our entity type is the category of entities such as user every single entity should be a user Caleb was a user Billy was a user we could have Jimmy John we could have Catherine we could have Caitlyn we could have Cassandra we could have you you get the point the attribute type is basically the categories of attributes so we had the uh the username we had the the name we had the password these are attribute types because we don't actually have a specific value if like no one's name is name when we actually give these specific values they no longer become types and they become specific examples so this guy over here here is our entity we can store so basically here's our entity we can store attributes about this entity the username can be Caleb Curry blah blah blah the name can be Caleb and the password can be uh Pi one 2 3 so these are specific attributes about that guy now oh these are all like complex terms and blah blah blah blah blah do really cares what really matters is can you put this into a table for people to understand who really cares if you know the terms but I mean I'm sure your professor cares so make him happy anyways in a table The Columns are the attributes so we could have for example an ID a password a username an email we could keep going address uh phone number and whatever else and then a row is where we give a value for every single one of these attributes all talking about one entity so like this guy this guy right here well his ID for example 72 his username is Caleb Curry his email is Cool Guy hotmail.com blah blah blah blah blah all of this row talks about this guy so basically just think attributes or columns entities are individual rows sweet then this whole thing right here this is the table and that is the entity type so the entity type would be user because every single row within this table should be a user oh another thing I would like to mention real quick um another name in mathematics for a row is a tupple or Tuple I think it's tupple I don't really know but that is another term you will hear so yeah tupple is a row thank you so yeah sorry for like yelling and getting all intense but it was fun all right so that's all I have to say in this video if you want to subscribe you better do that like right now just click subscribe and if you haven't subscribed yet you better subscribe and also click like if you have subscribed thank you and I will see you guys in the next video where we'll be talking about relational database Management Systems another big word which we will explain shortly so see you around
