what's up everybody welcome back to your database design series and I just wanted to share with you real quick you guys have literally used like all my chalk it's crazy so if there's any chalk companies out there and you're looking for sponsorship I will hook you up I will tell I will like I will advertise your product like every video I'll be like wow look how smooth that chalk is get some of your chalk or you guys could just like you you know send me a couple thousand dollars so I can buy like a lifetime supply of chalk that'd be pretty awesome but either way uh we're going to get into something new in this video and this is going to be called okay so there's a couple different names for this so basically it's just a standard it's a standard for drawing databases and the couple terms you might hear or acronyms I guess e model um e r d or ER model or just database design whichever one's easiest but basically these are some terms used to refer to a method used to draw out your entire database structure these videos I've been drawing tables and lines and draw my chalk drawing tables and lines and stuff and all kinds of cool things like that but actually haven't officially designed any database so what we're going to do now that we've learned learn most of the concepts the only thing we haven't really covered is normal forms which we'll be getting into those but anyways and I'll make them easy don't worry uh so what we're going to do is we're going to learn the standard for drawing these databases we're going to practice with that and then we're going to learn the normal forms and then we're going to design databases it's a lot of stuff but we're going to do it so we're going to be getting into the standards of drawing databases and obviously the standard's kind of rough I mean there's there's not a specific way you have to do everything because that's annoying and dumb so what we're going to do is we're going to be drawing pretty simple things and I'll just be kind of illustrating kind of how that works in this video so what this means is enhanced entity relationship model enhanced relationship diagram enhanced relationship model yeah I think that's what they stand for I don't think it stands for relation I think it stands for a relationship which there is a difference as you should probably know by now a relation is a table a relationship is a connection between two tables yeah so anyways uh yeah so we're going to be talking about these designing techniques I'll probably just call them like ERD or ER eer or who knows what I'll call them but yeah the way you do it is you define your database structure so anything that is ddl pretty much data definition language part of SQL we talked about that that a long time ago we're not going to define the actual values for example if we have a table for users we're not going to put in a row oh Caleb curry with the password of sweet pie is delicious 24 and the email of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.com and the uh telephone number of 1800 you wish or anything like that we're not going to put anything like that in there we're just going to put the columns username password email telephone 3D that is so cool okay anyways let's get started so to draw a table a database table you just draw a square it's like super easy okay wow people would have thought i' been so easy right and obviously doing this on a chalkboard is not very convenient because for one you're limited in space and for two most of you guys don't have chalkboards and for three I don't know a third reason but most of this is actually done on a computer and we will be doing that hopefully soon so stick with the these Concepts we'll be getting into on the computer design for whatever reasons and obviously as I make new videos in the future that's what I'll be doing so for now we'll learn the concepts and you can download entity relationship design programs such as MySQL workbench I made other ones like verell or something I don't remember what it's called and a couple others which you can design for any relational database man man agement system on that one so go check out my other videos or my playlist I think it's under reviews or something but I don't know look up database design on my channel see what I got you can also just look up eer or ER relationship or um design and you can get all kinds of apps and programs to help you design your databases and then some of them have what's known as engineering so you could forward engineer your database design and it'll basically just program your database for you and it's super easy yeah but I'm getting way off topic so let's get back on topic okay so here's how we draw a table what we do is we give it a table name so you put the table name either uh right here in a complete column like that or just right above it so we'll just put it above it right now so this is a user table and then what we can do within here is we put the columns this way vertically uh I mean we write them horizontally but we list them this way we're not putting them across here cuz if we put them across here we would assume that we're going to have row value like Caleb password and is awesome email is legit or cool and then like password I already said password but we're not doing that we're just going to put the columns so the First Column we could have is a user ID because we're just going to use a surrogate primary key in this example so we can have user ID now when you get into it you can also put other things like data types in here and any other restrictions you have such as not null if you wanted but for now and for most of the design for Design Concepts I'm not going to do that because I'm going to be writing the same thing over and over again and you kind of only do that when you're finalizing your database so you can kind of worry about the data types later on but for now we're just going to get the columns figure that out good we'll go from there so user ID uh username uh password and so forth uh hopefully you guys can read that probably not and then what we do if we want to create another table guess what we do oh we just draw another box right and we connect these with lines and we can there's certain ways to draw lines that represent different relationships like that's one way to do it or we could have like yeah I mean you get the point oh I found a nice big piece of chock cool all right so that's how you do that now um that's pretty much all the basics of entity relationship diagram drawing just remember um we put these in here the columns and what we can also do if we wanted we could put indexes down here we could put like index types and then we could also draw our relationship types with different lines and we can draw our foreign keys by either putting them down here or doing some other kind of thing now there's also other conventions you might hear heard of or have used like uml and other design techniques and I'm not saying those are bad I'm just saying this one's super easy for beginners and for experts so yeah now that's all I got to say in this video so be sure to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video where we'll be starting some awesome coolness so yeah see you there yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
