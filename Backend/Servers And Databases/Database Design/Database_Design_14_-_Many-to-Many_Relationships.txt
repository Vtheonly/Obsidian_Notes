hey guys welcome back to your database design video series in the last video we talked about one to many relationships the video about that we talk about one toone relationships well now we're talking about the third possibility of relationships and that is many to many relationships so when I think of many to many relationships I like to think of a polygamous marriage where multiple husbands can have multiple wives and multiple wives can have multiple husbands I like to just draw this out so you can kind of understand what this would be like we have the King right here right so let's say he's a king and he decides to marry three women just kind of make him real quick man this guy's why do you need three Wives come on oh that is there we go so this guy is married to these three women right and then he he's very protective but then he decides oh what the heck they can marry different men if they want who really cares so this girl marries this other guy right so now she's married to two people right what's wrong with her only the king can do that well not now because it's a one to many relationship one king can marry multiple women and one woman can marry multiple men so this guy is married to this girl and this girl is married to this guy over here and this guy is married to this girl over here so Sally is married to to Jim who is also married to this girl over here uh let's see if I can draw one here and this girl surprisingly is married to this guy who's married to Kathy who is also married to Jim and by the way Jim is married to the second wife of the king who the king is also married to this girl over here and you see it gets very complex very uh quickly that is an example of a many to many relationship now obviously you're not going to be storing like stuff like this in a database so let me think of a practical example real quick I to think of a college specifically a class and an instructor all right actually let's let's think of a class and a student so here is a class and here is a student okay now one class how many students can be in a class multiple you know that so we can have multiple students in this class let just draw boxes for quicker so let's say all these boxes are students a class can have multiple students well not only that but a student can take multiple classes so this student can take this class and this class can be taken also by that student and this student over here and then this student can take another class which can have this guy in it and this guy and this guy can be in this class as well and by the way he is all oh shoot I dropped my chalk he is also taking another class so he's in that class which has that student and that student and it just gets very complex so you can see this might be very very difficult to store within a relational database and there are reason we actually can't store this in a relational database you might be thinking well what if you need to store the classes that a student is taking in this students within a class we will be talking about in the up that in the upcoming videos with solving many to many problems many to many relationships do not work in a relational database the only two that will work is a one toone and a one to many relationship but this is just the concept you think of a concept of a many to many relationship think of a class and a student class can take many can have many students and a student can take many classes so yeah peace out check you out in the next video I mean I'm not going to check you out that's that's creepy
