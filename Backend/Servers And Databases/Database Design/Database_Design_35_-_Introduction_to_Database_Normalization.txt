hey what's up everybody welcome back and yes I know it is way past the deadline for me to get my luscious Mane trimmed I know you guys all love it but I'm just going to keep it for a while so I know it doesn't look too bad but I mean it it really is bad I mean if I can pull my hair past my lips that's it's kind of bad but anyways this video is going to be pretty simple I just want to introduce a topic so in the next three or so videos when we go over it it's going to be like kind of not all new to you you'll kind of have an idea of what's going on so we're going over what's known as normalization so normalization is a process where we go through our our database plan that we have and we start correcting things that may cause data Integrity problems or just repeating data etc etc whatever you want to say the normal forms are basically like a checklist that you're going to follow and when you get to the end you'll have a pretty good designed database so yeah there's three main forms and these are named very conveniently I have to admit first normal form second normal form and guess what the third one is yeah you guessed it third normal frame I'm kidding it's form that'd be weird though all right so we got first normal form second normal form and third normal form these are the three steps of normalization for databases now if you really really really want to get into database design you're just like man I love this stuff I got to get more well there's tons and more steps you can add and make things all complicated if you really want but for our practical purposes these are the only three that you're going to really really need and I know there's like a glare right here because of these lights and I know I'm just working on it so give me a couple videos and I I'll try to work on my lighting a bit but for now first normal form second normal form third normal form why do we have these well it's because we want a systematic way to follow to uh produce a normalized or a good structure database all right there's a couple things you should know when it comes to normalization we still have to talk about the idea of things being Atomic we want everything to be Atomic you also have to kind of think about data dependent on other data so if you think of like let's say a primary key you got 608 just a number that could refer to anything that could be a person an order an event whatever it is it's just a primary key and that also is going to have different columns in the table which have different attributes about whatever this thing is so let's say it's a person and we have a column for the name and let's say this dude's name is Caleb what a dumb name right uh this depends upon the primary key so what I mean by that is if we change the primary key we're going to also change the person right so let's say we have 609 well this is going to be a completely different person right because they're two separate entities this one's referring to some guy over here and this one is referring to some guy over here two separate entities you can also think oh by the way that that process or that uh thing this is called dependency so the next three videos we'll be going over the first normal form second normal form and the third normal form the other main thing is that these are kind of comprehensive I guess you could say so what that means is once you have first normal form now you can go on to the second normal form but you can't go jump in right here you have to have it in first normal form before you can get into second normal form same thing for second normal form into the third normal form so that means if you have a database that is in third normal form it is also in second normal form and in first normal form so I know I'm like getting all this technical on terms and junk so if it's freaking you out don't worry it's really simple got to get my my hair out out of my my face all right but basically it's a it's um a list of steps a list of things to do and basically you can't do this step two until you do step one so this here second normal form that's step two can't do this until you do that so you got to go through the process and then once you're at third normal form things are good to go so yeah that's really all I have to say peace
