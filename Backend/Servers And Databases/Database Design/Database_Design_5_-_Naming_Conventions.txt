hey what's up everyone this video is going to be a quick video over naming conventions so a naming convention is just a pattern that people do or that you do to keep things consistent so not only uh will this naming convention help keep my database consistent across different tables and columns but this naming convention is not only mine other people use this naming convention that means when I uh go to a different person to review my database they already understand what's going on now obviously there's multiple different naming conventions there's not one way to do everything and it's not required this is just how I decide to do it and this is because most people who use MySQL which is what I learned first use this but for different relational database Management Systems you may have different uh systems of naming things so I'm just going to explain what I'm going to do anytime I write SQL I put it in all capital letters so select is an example fortunately we're not going to be doing much SQL so I'm not going to have to write in all capitals on a chalkboard because it's it's quite complicated but when we're talking about anything I name myself I use all lowercase letters I just use all lowercase letters because I just think it makes it more simple so when we have a table such as a user table I don't capitalize the U and then when I have an ID I just put user ID or just ID whatever but I don't capitalize ID I just keep it lowercase and for spaces I just use an underscore so I don't use any spaces so basically that's my uh naming convention that I use and yours will very and um we haven't really got to this yet so you might not understand this but if I have a forign key basically if I have a copy a connection over here to where we have the same column over here I just make sure they're named both the same thing so I know what they're talking about so yeah I um some people do things such as put like user table or uh they capitalize certain words and if you want to look at other naming conventions for your specific relational database management system go right ahead in fact I'd encourage it but just so you understand what I'm doing here uh I will be doing that another thing when we're talking about stuff in the real world sometimes I don't necessarily use that naming convention because if I'm writing everything I need to store about a user well I might just put uh we need to store the user's address I'm not going to put theore users uncore address I might just put the users address with space in English and then when I convert when I uh start making this into a database structure schema whatever you want to call it then I'm going to convert that to just address lowercase so yeah that's introduction to um I already it's way too late it's like 4:00 uh that that's basically our convention so yes see in the next video be sure to subscribe yeah
