hey everyone welcome to your database design video this one will be over onetoone relationships so a on toone relationship um basically just means that one entity has a connection with one other entity and that's all they can have I like to think of a marriage so we have a husband and wife this is a one toone relationship because a husband can have one wife and that wife can have one husband the husband can't have multiple wives and the wife the wife can't have multiple husbands it's one to one because one entity is limited to one other entity this entity is also limited to one other entity it's a one toone relationship so another example of a one: one relationship would be a social security number all right so a social security number in America is basically just a unique number every citizen is given there are uh I think there's occasional repeats although generally you think of a social security number as being unique to one person so we Define it as a one toone relationship even if there's possibilities of being repeated data one person only has one social security number generally that social security number is only supposed to have one person so we have a a person and then we have a Social Security number one person has one social security number one one social security number is assigned to one person if you want to draw out your relationships you can say person has one social security number Social Security number assigned I'm sorry yeah okay so assigned to one person so person is a a social security number Social Security number is assigned to one person we would not even though there's a possibility that the social security number might be repeated we wouldn't design it this way because that's like saying the social security number is supposed to be signed assigned to multiple people it's not supposed to it's supposed to be unique for the person so we design it as a one: one relationship um we're going to be talking about a a on to many relationship in the next video and then a many to many relationship and after that we'll be talking about how we Design This within a database how do we structure our tables so this video is just going to be talking about the concept which we just did so that's really all I have to say and I will see you in the next video
