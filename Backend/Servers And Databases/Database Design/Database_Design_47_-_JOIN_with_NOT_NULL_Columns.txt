hello everybody in this video I want to continue on the join discussion we've been doing in these last couple videos so be sure to check those out well I've been talking a little bit about not n columns basically columns that aren't allowed to have no value and that can cause some confusion when it comes to joins because you might get results you don't expect and I'm just going to be explaining that just a tiny bit more this video will be quick so if you already understand it go right ahead and skip it if that's what you wish all right so I'm going to be going over an example of a user comment system so basically you're going to have a table with the users and then you're going to have something such as a comment table and you might have a table such as video or blog or whatever you're commenting on but that's out of the illustration for now don't worry about that well in this example we have some columns that are labeled not null and what this means is that you're not allowed to have them to where there's no value in in that Row for that column so for example if in comment we had comment ID and then we had user ID and we gave it a column characteristic of not null well what is that going to do that's going to basically say that every single row within this comment table has to have a user ID associated with that comment and that would be the person who posted that comment now the user on the other hand doesn't have to post a comment it's a one to many relationship and the user does not have to post a comment but a comment has to be owned by a user that's important to know so there's three real possible options of joins that we could do on this table the first is an inner join I'm going to put these in caps because it's probably just better to do that now the inner join does not matter which one is left or right because it's going to take the middle of both of them so the positioning of your uh tables within your query of the select statement does not really matter all it matters is that you're using the inner join what is the inner join going to give you and the in join will give you uh all of the users who have comments that's because if a user doesn't have a comment it's not going to be in his ID won't be in the comment table and he'll be left out uh if there's a comment that doesn't have a user well then it would be left out too but that's not the case case cuz it's not null right the other option is a left outer joint and I'm going to go into place places in a second left outer join and then we could put the comment on the left so if you need help position if you need help thinking about that in your head switch these two tables around but I'm not going to do that because that's part of the illustration already we're good all right the other opt option well actually let's talk about what that's going to do first left out or join is going to give you all of the comments and then give you the associated users who have posted those comments so every single comment will be included so the return result will be all comments and Associated users okay now think about this though these things are actually going to give you the same exact thing that's because if you do an inner join it's going to give you all the users who have comments okay so it's going to take you all of the users who have a comment put it in there and then it's going to take all the comments that have a user and put it in there you hear that all the comments that have a user all the comments that have a user so these are going to give you the same result so just understand that the third option is to flip the left join the the tables that is so we got a left outer join with the user table on left okay now what is this going to do it's going to give you all of the users and the associated comments from those users now let's talk about so we're going to have it's either uh it either includes them all or excludes some of them so basically if it includes all of the users I'm going to label it with a star if it only includes some users I'm going to label it with an X same for the comments all the comments is going to be a star some of the comments is going to be an X so users who have comments well only some users are going to post comments so that's going to be X on the user end but all of the users who have comments that's going to include all of the comments because all of the comments are labeled as not null so every user posted a comment has a row within the comment table so it's going to return them all so it's going to return them all on the user end that's a star now left out or join with the comments on left returns all comments and Associated users all the comments so all the uh on the uh comment side it's going to return them all but the users not all of them just part of them now left outer join it's going to return all users and Associated comments so the first one is some users all comments the second one is Su users all comments the third one is all users and all comments this that's what you kind of need to do when you're trying to plan out which join you need to use go through all the possibilities with that join and just write them out so you see that these two are actually the same this one is just a tiny bit different and that includes all of the users so you may be wondering well which of these two should you use well to be honest it doesn't really matter if you if you wanted to return all of the comments don't worry about whether it's not null or not just use a left out or join with comments on the left and then you're guaranteed to have that you don't have to worry about whether it's not nle or not so that's what I would do if you only want the users and the comments included and you don't want to include any comments that don't have a user which is never going to happen then you do a uh inner join so what you do is you just think and pretend all the com all the columns are nullable or they don't have to have a value and then you plan your joins around that and it can still work the same way if that's what you'd like to do otherwise you can just plan out like this and realize you can use either one of these and it's going to work out fine for what you want to do so yeah okay I guess this video was a little longer than I thought and it was uh kind of complex and confusing so I apologize if it was a little too pointless or just was counterproductive but in the next video we will be discussing something new so thank you guys for watching pleas please be sure to subscribe and I'll catch you in the next video bye
