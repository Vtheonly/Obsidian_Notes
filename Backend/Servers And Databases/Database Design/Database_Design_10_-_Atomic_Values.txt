hey what's up everyone uh my name is Caleb this video we'll be talking about Atomic values so Atomic values basically just mean that it means that the value stores one thing everything we store in a database should be one thing when we have columns they're about one thing all of the values within that column are one thing we have a column name well what does a name consist of you can have a first name middle name and last name well this although we're talking about one thing in name it's not really necessary Atomic because we're storing three names within one name so if we wanted to make this Atomic the best thing to do for database design would be to break this up into first name middle name and last name so now we have Caleb Daniel Curry three separate names right all right so when we do store things in a database we want to go we want to try to make them Atomic now we don't want to go to the extreme where we break everything apart to where it doesn't even make any sense but uh just think of like atom an atom Atomic when this word came about we never really split an atom so we thought of an atom as the smallest indivisible indivisible I think is the word a piece of information in this world now we can split it but whatever just so uh sometimes you may think well this isn't really a good term but everyone will still use this term so just think of atomic as the smallest one one individual thing stored now we don't want to go to the extreme for example if we have the word subscribe this is a word it's one word don't go to the extreme where we separate it into like word like individual letters because that'd be ridiculous it's like all right uh we store in a table instead of having first name last name we have first letter of the first name second letter of the uh first name third letter of the first name fourth letter of the first name that doesn't make sense we want to break it down until we can treat it as one thing for example an a a phone number it often has an area code well we don't want to break a phone number up into multiple portions I often just store phone numbers as one because you treat it as one thing um when we come when it comes to addresses well an address consists of like multiple we have we have a a street address we have a city and then we have a state we have uh an area code or zip code I mean so addresses I often break this up into multiple columns rather than storing one address with uh one two three epic Lane legit California 7 3 82 1 rather than storing all of that in one column I break this up into street address city state area code and then that allows us to run more complex uh queries on our data because we can select all of the users from the state of California or we can select all of the users uh who live in this in this uh City or pretty much anything like that so uh this is part of one of the normal forms which we will be talking about in the future but as for now just think of storing everything as one so not only do we want the column to be about one thing like an address is just an address or a phone number is just a phone number but we want the values within that to be singular as well for example we could have a column uh favorite movies this isn't going to work because within that column we could store unlimited movies and that is also improper so that's not going to work as well every single column header should be singular favorite movie and you may be asking well how would you store multiple movies well that has to do with um more complex relationships and that is something we'll be talking about very shortly but the solution is not to store multiple things within a column so yeah uh that's all I have to say about Atomic values thank you for watching this video if you liked it please be sure to that's what's different I knew this scene looked different I didn't have the light on man anyways thank you for watching please be sure to to subscribe and click like
