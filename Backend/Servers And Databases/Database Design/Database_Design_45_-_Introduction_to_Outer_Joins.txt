what's up dude in this video we are going to be talking about outer joints so in the last video we talked about inner joints and the video before that we talked about inner joints and two videos before that we talked about inner joins so I'm basically sick and tired of inner joints so now we're just going to be doing the same exact thing except with outer joints so what's the difference between an inner joint and an outer joint that's what we will be discussing in this entire video it's going to be about 20 videos so hold no I'm kiding it won't take too long once you understand what an inner joint is picking up outer joints in the other junk is like super easy okay kind of how like once you learn a one programming language the second one is only somewhat less hard right you can see I have some junk written behind me let's look at it all right so we have what's known as a join condition that is at the end of the join statement do you remember doing this I can't hear you I'm just kidding okay so we got the customer. customer ID and card. customer ID that means there's two tables the customer table and the card table and then both of these have a column customer ID it's a basically just simple dot syntax the table do column and this is making an association so this is saying that we we want to join two tables and the rows that need to be connected are connected by the colum of uh I lost it customer ID and customer ID so the two columns here this is going to make a connection and our join is going to build is going to be built upon that so we know where to connect things so the way this would work with an inner join let me just show you we got let me just redraw those two tables real quick we have the the customer and then we have the card so this is like a bank and people can get credit cards and a person doesn't necessarily have to have a credit card because they can go to that bank without having a credit card and also a car doesn't necessarily have to have a current owner because it could be a disabled card or it could be a um a card that hasn't yet been activated or something else could happen to where a person doesn't own that card so there's no required columns for this now when we join these the join table is going to only include customers who own a card that's going to be the end result that is with a inner join so we have the uh customer card join table of card and the customer that is exclusive pushing away all of the customers with no cards and all of the cards without an Associated customer who owns that card the outer join Works a little differently in that it's still going to return all of the rows of from one of these tables you can decide which one whether or not they have an Associated entity on the other side so that join statement comes in here it's important so we had it to where it was um the customer ID I'm just going to put C for short if we have it where we have it what's known as a left join I'm just going to write it over here it's going to basically basically ignore that statement and it's going to return all of the rows from the left table the right one though is still going to be obeying that join statement so the join statement let me write it out was a c um customer so with this left join all of the rows are going to ignore this on the left side so it's going to return back every single row on the right side though it's going to only return the ones that have a customer ID that has a customer ID of the same value within the customer table so for example we could have a card with the ID the customer ID of seven so that's customer ID not card ID so that's referring to the person who actually owns the card all right we can have that person over here and since if you basically insert this into the join condition we have 7 equal 7 because this card customer ID has an equal value in this table which means this card is owned by that person it's kind of how it works but with an outer join we are going to ignore that and basically say we're going to return all of the rows for either the left or right side so there are M there are three main classifications of joins outer joins that are I'm going to write them all and then in the next videos we are going to discuss them there's a left outer join right outer join and an did I seriously Outer Outer join ah I am so I meant to write full outer join excuse me for oh man but basically we're going to be discussing these two right off hand and fool that can be a little more complicated for some database Management Systems so we're going to probably discuss that a little farther down the road hopefully so let's Dive Right In with left outer joins I will catch you in the next video thank you for watching please be sure to subscribe and I'll see you in the next video I already said that
