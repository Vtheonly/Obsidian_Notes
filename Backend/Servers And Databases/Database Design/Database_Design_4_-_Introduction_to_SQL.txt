hey what's up everybody welcome back uh if you like this video be sure to subscribe uh this video will'll be talking about SQL so SQ L all right so what is SQL SQL is a programming language used to communicate to a database basically um we speak English databases do not so SQL is kind of like the mediator between computer database and human English think of it like that it's almost English it's very simple and in this series we're not actually going to be programming any databases although we will be talking about General SQL Concepts so it's important that you know about SQL so SQL is not like a specific relational database management system programming language it is a general language used for every single relational database management system uh from vendor to vendor such as MySQL to uh SQL server or something else it might vary a little bit but the general concepts of SQL stay the same so this is this is going to be a general concept that you should know about so SQL first is used to define the database structure and then it manipulates the data within so basically we can kind of think of SQL as two categories here one it defines the structure and then two it manipulates by that it means we insert data and then we can search it or delete it or update it these are the two subcategories of SQL we have actually for some reason name these their own languages so this is data definition language or ddl and this is data manipulation language or DML um some people may say there's more categories but I mean this is pretty much the the main two so think of it like this I'm just going to erase this here now that we have this we have ddl DML when we have like a table for example I'm just going to write this down here um and we have the columns so we have like ID username password well that's data definition language data manipulation language is what we would use to insert a new value such as the ID of 72 the username of Caleb Curry the password of pi1 123 that's data manipul ation language so when you think of a table and if obviously if you have a big database you're going to have multiple tables well all of the structure and the connection between tables that's all data definition language so it gets all of the main structure of the database and then the the data within the database is data manipulation language so those are the two main categories um just I just want to talk about some of the features of both of these languages so basically when we Define tables uh we have a create statement so basically um all SQL I write an all capital letters that's just a p a pattern that I've chosen so create is an example of an SQL command used to create tables and uh we can create a database this way that is data definition language which because we're defining the structure of our database a command such as update or uh yeah I guess so update if we're updating the actual values within columns well this is manipulation language because we're not changing the structure the column stays the same just a specific attribute of an entity changes we're updating Caleb Curry's username to Caleb Curry 123 well that's data manipulation language another thing that SQL can do is what's known as a join and joins are very important very important with the relational database management system because with the relational database management system we break things up into Separate Tables for Simplicity sake for one sorry was I out of the scene there I think I was there whatever rather than having a spreadsheet with like tons of information we break it off by entity so here's a table about the user here's a table about the orders here's a table about the customers then we can join those values to get a new larger table a new view that looks like a huge unorganized table I mean basically it looks uh it doesn't look like we broke it up into multiple tables so if we have a table here and then we have a table here and let's just say we have this is a sale table and this is a user table within the sale table we have a sale ID we have a user ID the person who bought the stuff and then we have the objects that they bought and I mean this is just a silly example just for you to understand the concept of a join and then within the users table we have the the name the user ID and so forth we can do a join here we could take the objects that they bought the person the objects that the person bought as well as the name of the person who bought it connected by the user ID which we'll we'll talk about this more then we can get a new view which has the name and the items that that name bought and it's all talking about the same entity this user so that's just uh some of the basics of SQL in the next video we'll be either talking about like I think we'll talk about uh naming conventions yeah I think that's what we'll do all right so thank you for watching if you enjoyed that please be sure to subscribe and click
