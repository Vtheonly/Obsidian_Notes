hey guys welcome back this video we will be discussing data types I almost forgot there anyways what a data type is is when you create a column every single value in that column has to be of a certain data type so you need to tell that column when you create the database what data type it is to be also when you're designing you usually put the data types there as well so that way you have an idea of how your database is going to work work so there's three main categories of data types and the naming conventions or the names of these data types from one database management system to another database management system might vary a little bit but in general they're organized into three main kinds that's date numeric and string so basically we're going to be going over these in a little bit of depth we're not going to go super in depth because right now you just need to understand what these are and just understand that your database application might be slightly different from others let's start from the bottom up just to make things fun string string is any characters or like letters so basically you put these within quotes so hey this is an example of a string even a number within quotes can be used as a string and this this would be used as a string basically the uh the three doesn't have any mathematical value unless it's converted to numeric within string you'll often have some subcategories you'll have something that's either Char or varchar which those just mean character or variable character what that means is it's just like um a list of characters the character or char usually is stuff that's set in length so like a phone number or a zip code something that doesn't change sizewise so basically with a Char you'll you'll have it something like CH 8 and every single value within that Char column is going to be stored as a individual characters now even if you don't put eight characters let's say you put six then there's going to be two blank characters in there so they're all stored as eight varar on the other hand is variable basically meaning that the size can change you can have anywhere from zero up to eight there's also often the subcategory or subd dat type of text which is often used for larger things such as comments messages and so forth that's basic summary of the string data types as for numeric data types these are numbers that's different than this this is a string that has a number in it that's used differently than the numeric data type the numeric data type doesn't have quotes it's just the numbers that you're using just like string there's often some subcategories of decimal and then floating point or double decimal Works in base 10 now I know we haven't really gotten much into bases and I'm just going to put date back up here since we haven't got that yet but I think it's really important to know and in fact I've made a lot of videos over binary hexadecimal and stuff basically different numbering systems that use different bases well decimal uses base 10 it's the number system we're used to counting in you know 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then it goes back to 10 11 12 13 14 if it's base 10 that's what de means in decimal well there's also binary so we have decimal and then we have a binary decimal is base 10 binaries in base two so binary we only have the options of zero and one now you don't really need to understand how to like calculate in binary but if you want to know that I do have videos for that but just know when we're working with decimal it is working with a base 10 system when we're working with floating points we're working with binary which is stored differently it's stored in binary and then you can have it presented as decimal for math or whatever so what's really the difference do you use decimal or do you use floating points it just kind of really depends decimal generally is more accurate on mathematics to a point there are problems that can come up with decimal but you'll just have to research those but basically uh this one has some errors binary it has problems with certain mathematical equations or numbers for example when we want to store 1/4 it's stored like this we have 0 Z one and the way this kind of works is we have anything after the point that divides the number basically in half so we would have half but we don't have half so we have half of a half 1/4 kind of makes sense so the the place values would be this one right here would be uh we'd have half this place value would be 1/4 and then anything after that would be 1/8 and anything after that would be 116th so right now way we have it we would take 12 multiply it by 0 to get zero because we don't have anything there we take 1/4 multiply by one since we have it there we' get 1/4 0 0 we add those up we get 1/4 basic uh adding and multiplying to understand how it works but when we have a number such as 0.1 in decimal that is basically impossible to store in binary simply because we're working in a base 2 system and we can't get 2.1 very easily because 1/8 that doesn't quite cut it you'd have to basically have a combination of a bunch of different fractions to get as close as possible 2.1 but you can never really get there perfectly so that's a problem with the floating points so if you needed to store something like that you would if it needs to have that accuracy you would have to have it stored as a decimal which stores it differently that was a lot sorry if I completely overwhelmed you with that number stuff and if I did don't even worry about it that was a little too fast if you need it slower please check out my introduction to Binary video it's a super long video where I basically explain it step by step so you understand and then I have a couple other videos adding and subtracting and also fractions in a binary you will also have an integer type which will only store numbers that don't have any decimals after them so only whole numbers like 5 12 28 52 so forth with numbers we also have to worry about whether they are unsigned or signed if they are unsigned numbers that means that they can't be negative if they're signed that means they can be positive or negative you're probably wondering why would you ever do that well if you're working with something that doesn't go negative well then you wouldn't need to have that negative when you have a signed number and it can be positive or negative the range of potential values stays the same but since you include negatives the maximum value is different it's not as high think about if you have a range from 0 to a th000 but then you include negatives now you have from 500 to 500 that is going to be told with the data type so you might say something like double unsigned that would work as a number that's enough for numbers I don't want to talk about this anymore let's talk about dates dates well there's couple different things you need to know about dates there's date then there's time there's date time and then there's timestamp so let's talk about date time first because it makes sense the best it basically just stores a dates such as you know 02 for February then you might have a colon you might have 22 for the date 22nd and then a colon maybe 1998 for 1998 the year then you have the time which could be whatever it could be 12 30 22 which would be the seconds and you might even be able to have some milliseconds or micros seconds that's how you would store a date time the way it actually looks might vary from database management system to database management system some might have colons between the numbers some some might have hyphens or commas or whatever doesn't really matter I don't want you to think about that right now I just want you to think about the date being a date and the time being a time date time being the combination of a date and a time that's pretty much that for dates the only other thing is the time stamp the time stamp is an ex exact moment in time that's recorded to establish when something was created or done it can be in milliseconds or it can be in the month and the day and then the second hour and then the seconds and then the milliseconds or it can just be a number of seconds so forth it varies but anyways that's going to give you a number when something was done it's usually for something like when an account was created or when a transaction was done or when something happened when you update a column that Tim stamp will often update and that's going to keep it to like when that row was entered into the database so if you enter a new row and one of the columns is a timestamp it's going to give you a value as soon as you submit that and it's put into the database the timestamps created and it says okay this row was entered at this time that's the main thing with um timestamps so so basically we got three types of data types we got string um numeric and then date all of those classifications have different data types for each one but in general as long as you know like the gist of what is what you'll be fine you don't have to worry too much because when you get in actually programming a database you will have more specifics on what data types to use so you guys thank you for watching sorry for rambling in this video is a long one peace out
