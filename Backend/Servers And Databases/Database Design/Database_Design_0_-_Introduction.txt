oh hey what's up everybody so uh for those of you who do not know me my name is Caleb from Caleb the video maker uh to and Caleb c.com so I'm sure most of you are asking oh what is this video about what is this a new series or something all right well yeah actually it is I decided to start a new series over database design so I I did a a design series a while ago was my first video series here on YouTube uh was about 25 videos long and then I went on to make a 67p part video series over MySQL and I did a couple other ones I have over a 100 uh databasing videos and I wanted to I wanted to try to tackle this again to try to make it better explain things better and also bring you to a new level of skill so what what level of difficulty is this course going to be it's going to be for beginners although the destination is going to be much higher than the destination of my first series my first database design series which by the way if you want to check that out if you're completely new to things I will link to that in the description but that series was for absolute beginners uh no experience whatsoever this series I'm still going to be treating everyone as if they're beginners working their way up although it may be just a tad bit more advanced so if necessary you can check out that series and if you want to know how to implement your database design into a database check out my MySQL series both will be linked in in the description below but as for this series I am going to be talking about all of the topics within my first database design series and specifically for relational databases so a relational database is just um it separates everything into Separate Tables so uh MySQL is an example of a relational database most most database design is used for relational databases because it's a big process so why do you want to use a series well if you are let's say You're just bored like which I don't even know why you're here but if that's the case this series will be awesome because databasing design is fun database design I should say and uh it's going to be interesting it's kind of like a puzzle which I know some of you hate puzzles but this'll be fun trust me guys it'll be sweet all right so the second thing is if you're just in general it or computer science well knowing database will set you apart from a lot of people because a lot of people blow it off like it's not that big of a deal when in reality most platforms programs applications rely on a backend database that's how we store information in this world everything we do is powered by a database so it's important that you know how to properly Implement database Concepts designs to know how to properly structure data so that way you get the best optimized database that will set you apart from the rest of the IT team or the rest of your classmates it will give you the skills needed to get that job or whatever you want to do with it uh also if you're just a business person or you have your own project and you need to learn how to build a website or you need a database to store all the information you're using this series will be helpful third thing is if you are interested in being a database administrator which is where you want to do databasing for a living well then this series is going to be like having because everything in this series you're going to need to know and you you'll need to know more than that but this series will be the start of a lot all right so from there what was I going to say ah I don't know anyways um basically database design is the fundamentals of databases you should know how to properly structure data um this series is not going to be very spe specific on a spe on a certain database management system so this isn't like mySQL database design this isn't like Oracle this isn't SQL Server this isn't whatever else you use this is going to be General database design so then you can take these skills and apply them to any of the databases that you are working on that are relational which I mean through this series you you'll really understand what that means if you don't get that all right so uh I don't want to ramble on but I do just want to explain some things about what the series will consist of basically we'll start explaining the database Concepts using this sweet legit new chalkboard which is awesome yeah got it at a yard sale for like it was like 15 bucks and I bargained it down to 10 it's awesome except it doesn't have a stand seriously I'm like balancing it on a bunch of books right now anyways what was I saying all right so oh I'm all red so the first part is going to be a lot of the concept steps on the chalkboard and I'm not going to like write tons of scripts on here so don't worry it's not going to be confusing to where you can't see the code on a screen because in reality a lot of database design is not done on a computer first first you have to think about it and then you kind of just draw out your plans whether it be in your head or on a document or if you use a database design program I use a chalkboard because I can easily draw Out Concepts thoughts way the way data is connected and all of that so a lot of these databasing um videos they're going to be on this chalkboard because that's all you really need we're not we're not programming a database we're designing a database and designing is Art you draw it you design it after we go through a lot of the concepts is when we will be going into specific examples where we will be going on the computer using a design program to teach how to uh put that in a computer program for a uh visual schema of your database so I'm not sure what program we use maybe MySQL workbench but whatever it is a lot of the programs will be Universal no matter what um relational database management system you use so a lot of the concepts from this video will be useful no matter what uh you will be using for your database base so not only will you get the concepts out here on this chalkboard but you will get real uh practical use of programs on the computer where you will get your training so we have education computer training um basically the whole series where we're on the chalkboard you can kind of just watch whichever video you need if necessary I do recommend you watch all the way from the beginning to the end but if you just need to know about like primary keys or candidate keys or whatever it is you can just check out that video now when we go on to the computer screen that's when we'll be kind of going through practical examples and it's kind of confusing to jump in right in the middle so if you want to just uh if you want to watch the on screen videos I'd recommend you start from the very first onscreen video and they'll all kind of be in a row so yeah uh this series compared to the last will have more content better content more in-depth content better explained content I've taken a lot of the suggestions from my previous series implement mented them into this series and it's going to be awesome from this series Once you understand the database Concepts is when you apply it to a specific database management system so I I made a series over MySQL that is a relational database management system that's how we create our database that's how we manage it well a lot of the Design Concepts I apply to that and then when I program with mySQL I understand what I'm doing it's a lot better so after this series um a lot of the stuff in this series will be kind of almost like the Design Concepts will be useful but once we get into the very specific differences between relational database Management Systems it's going to be a lot of conceptual stuff because I can't really Implement every single uh relational database management system in this series because it'd be like a million videos long so it's more important to get the ideas and the concepts behind why we do things and then you can apply those to whatever relational database management system there is rather than learning oh mySQL database design you just learn database design in general you can apply that anywhere if you want more complimentary material check out my website Caleb curry.com and then you go blogs is the current URL I'll put that link in the description as well that is going to have blogs that actually has this content in textual pict tutorial form where you can you know like read it and stuff if that's what you're into which I mean why would you read it when you can watch it I mean come on I'm just kidding if you want to read go check that out the other thing is I would really really really appreciate it if you subscribe to my YouTube channel and as you go through this series click like on my videos uh when you get to the first video be sure to share that to your friends to get more uh views and feedback for me to improve upon further so yeah I don't really have much else to say except for the fact that the series is going to be a blast and I'm excited like super excited especially with this awesome new chalkboard like seriously it's awesome all right so yeah starting in video one I'm not going to be explaining a whole bunch of the background crap that's why I just made this introduction video that way those of you who care can watch and those of you who don't care you don't have to watch so video one we're just going to kind of jump right into things and from there I just going to try and keep it simple stupid and make things easy to understand and I'm going to try to make things as correct as possible uh if you have any questions just leave a comment on the video if you have any suggestions leave a comment on the video and if you like the video click like And subscribe that's all that I ask of you and um share it with your friends so yeah thanks once again it's Caleb that's my name so for future reference I'm probably going to say that in every single video because I don't know it's kind of habit now hey what's up what's up it's Caleb all right so yeah I will see you guys in the next video peace yeah
