hello ladies and gentlemen my name is Caleb as you probably know because you've been watching this entire Series so this video we're going to be picking up from where we stopped last video which we were talking about candidate keys so this video we're going to be talking about primary Keys which is the next step so what is a primary key well in the last video we we defined some possibilities for candidate Keys something we could use as the main key it's a candidate because we have to pick it to be our primary key so we have a list of possibilities one of them was a username another was an email and then if you don't have something simple like this you could do something like your full name which that would be like first name last name middle name and then plus an address which address would probably be broken up and into like Street City uh you know like all the parts of an address and then possibly your birth date or just dob so here are just some possibilities for candidate Keys we could have username email first name middle name blah blah blah well now once you have all your possible candidate Keys you want to pick one to be your primary key so how do you do that well once again you got to make sure we look at the the tools or suggestions for keys this is specifically talking about primary Keys we want our primary key to be unique never changing and never null so username is never going to change right so that's pretty good you always need a username when you sign up for an account so it's never null and it has to be unique because two people can't have the same username so this would be a good primary key let's check out email well it's you can make it unique you can require people to uh only have like you can prevent multiple emails so when you create an account you can only use an email that has not been used that's an option so that's possible never changing well it depends depends on if it if you're use your email like a user account username like you sign in with your email and you have a password too well then the chances are you're not going to be able to change it although now uh you can probably update your email and stuffff so it's possible to be never changing if you prevent people from updating their main email so possible possible and never null you can require someone to have an email so that's possible all three of these are possible so this is a a possible I'll just put a dash first name last name middle name address date of birth well probably the whole group as a whole will be unique the chances of finding someone with your same name living at the same place as you with the same date of birth is almost impossible so unique practically yes but possible you can possibly have a duplicate so possible never changing oh well people can get married so their last name can change first name can even change your middle name can change you can move you can't be born a different date you can't be born again like unless you become a Christian but anyways never know well some people might not have an address either that or they might not have a middle name or something like that so this is probably not the best primary key so in this example I'd probably go with the username and then you define that as your primary key and then you can use that to make connections between tables so you have a comment by a username that's the connection that is a natural key and we'll be talking about surrogate keys in the next video if you know anything about that but basically you can use your username as an ID rather like as a primary key so you could have let's say this is my username this can be the connection for all of my rows by me so if I have a table for comments a table for users a table for for sales well if I buy something Caleb Curry connection if I post if I'm a user well connection if I uh post a comment connection it all kind of points back to the user table because that's going to be the parent of the uh relationship here so this could be a primary key so that's a a primary key now this will also be indexed because primary key is a source of is a type of index so you can do select statements really easily with that and everything like that so that's going to be how you connect most of your data now the other candidate keys that we did not choose they're known as alternate Keys an alternate key it works I mean you can it can be it could be the primary key but basically it's all the candidate keys that were not selected as the primary key you do not you're not required to Define all of your alternate keys in your database in fact you don't even need any alternate keys but you may want to because often times they will be something you're doing searches for or uh connecting tables or whatever it is alternate Keys might be useful so you can create an index on the alternate key so I could create an index on the emails for example because I said that was a a possibility well now that can uh that'll be an index and it will probably be used because you might want to do data by the emails like selecting Everyone by their email you know what I mean maybe possibly basically uh you can you can do a select and then you can choose the columns you want to choose and then the table and then you can say where and then you could say like email has the value legit at awesome.com because you have an index on that it's going to work better so if you have a really good alternate key I recommend you index it simply for uh good design and it'll help your database run faster but if you don't really want to index on it then don't do it because that's just another thing your database is going to have to maintain it's going to have to update the index as well as the book sort of how if I have a book here and I change the insides of the book well then the index in the back is going to have to change too so alternate Keys you can set them as uh an index if they are good and useful if you will be searching for that kind of information so that is Introduction to primary keys and alternate keys don't really have much else to say the next video we'll probably be talking about when you see people do things like user ID which is a really common way for people to Define primary Keys you'll connect things by IDs we'll be talking about that in the next video and when we should do that and when we shouldn't do that all right so thank you for watching hopefully that was helpful and be sure to subscribe
