hey everybody welcome back to your database design Series this video I wanted to talk a little bit more about introduction to Keys although I'm going to go just a bit off topic and I'm going to talk about indexes so I don't think we talked much about these in this series yet but we are going to be talking about an index all right so what's an index I'm not going to be explaining every single detail of indexes because we're not really talking about indexes in this video we're talking about keys so I'm just explaining enough so you understand understand how this relates to keys so think of an index best example I have is a book so if I have a really awesome book like like physics or something what I can do is I'm like oh I want to know about this I can flip open to the back right and I can travel to the [Music] index and I be like oh yeah oh that looks nice page 7,832 and then I can read about that well that's a lot quicker than being like o I want to know about this page one not on there page two nope not there no not there oh nope not there no nope no and keep going through the entire book until you find it that'll take forever another good example is a phone book when you go through a phone book you have uh everything's alphabetic and it has the data right there so when you think of an index in a book it points you to the data whereas a phone book it just has the data there you can be like Oh I'm going to go to the letter G find Grandma and call her right that's kind of how an index works and it's very similar for a database if we had a table and it's like a user table boom boom boom boom user and let's say we have six billion rows in this that's pretty crazy number and we want to find everybody with the name Caleb just Caleb yeah we want to find everyone with the name Caleb well without indexes basically the database is going to go Row one does it have the name Caleb no it doesn't row two does it have the name Caleb no Row three yes it does we'll put that we'll put that back in the return statement and then it goes through every single sing every single row within the entire table which take ages so if we give it an index and we sort we order that data in a way that the database knows how to find certain like it could know exactly where the C's are well then it can go straight to the C's grab all the calebs and boom it's done it's like super fast that's kind of how an index works well what's that to do with keys well when we Define a key it's actually a type of index that's because keys and indexes are used for select statements wear Clauses and joins so I could do something like select everything from users for example there's just like a SQL example I mean it it'll vary from whatever uh programming like relational database management system you use this is a general example and then I could say where now this is where I specify holy cow sorry dropped the weight just holding my books anyways I'm selecting all of the columns and then I want to select every column where first name has the value Caleb for example well that's how we would do this this right here this whole wear thing well it's best to have an index for that another thing we commonly do are joins which is basically combining two tables and I'm not going to go into all the Syntax for all that basically if we have a table over here users and then a table over here comments and we want to make a generate a new view where we have all of the comments from a user and all of the information about that user we could have a new generated View and we can join these statements and how does it know how to join it it uses the I it uses the uh the key right so if we have a primary key and let's say we used usern name so the key I'll draw the key here the key is username well what how would we join it we would say I want you to take this table and this table and then combine all of the rows where the username is Caleb Curry over here and the username is Caleb Curry over here so that way it knows all of these comments are from Caleb Curry which we can assign to that user with the name Caleb Curry or you might often see it with like an ID number so it could be like id6 take all the comments from the user with the ID of six join it with the I'm sorry take all the rows with the uh user with the ID of six join it with all of the rows with the user of ID six and it combines them individual rows for each ID with an when we make a uh primary key or just a key for now well we're defining an index so the data datase can easily access the order of our data and combine things so that is how kind of how indexes relate to Keys key is a type of index there are all kinds of types of indexes and we will talk more about that in upcoming videos but for now that's really all I got to say so yeah peace out check check out the next video see you guys later bye
