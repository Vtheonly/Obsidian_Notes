hey what's up everybody welcome back to your database design Series in the previous video we talked about a one to one relationship that is one of the three kinds of relationships that we can have the other one is one to many what that means is that one entity can have a relationship with multiple other entities but a specific entity can only be related back to one one other entity I know that sounds a little confusing when confusing when we're talking about entities and all this conceptual highle thinking but think of think of it like comment on a website when you go on to YouTube or whatever and you go below you can leave a comment on my videos that comment is only owned by you it has your it has your name name that is a on to many relationship the reason for that is you can make many comments but an individual comment is only owned by one person so to draw that out you have uh a user and we have multiple comments you can see that the user is able to make multiple comments but each individual comment like this one for example is only owned by one user that is a one to many relationship or one colon many can you see that yeah I think you can so this is how a one to many relationship Works uh if you want to think again of like the marriage thing think of a king we'll just name him King Sam and Sam demands to have multiple wives and he's super controlling of his wives so Sam has multiple wives right sorry I'm just kind of drying off my chalkboard here we have Sam the king over here give him a crown give him a big smile and he is just Royal and famous among the lands and he's really selfish with his women he demands to have 500 wives or however many wives he desires so we have all of his wives over here so he has these two wives and then he has this wife over here she's not so good-look but anyways he is married to these three wives although he's very he's very protective and very selfish with his women and he does not want these wives to marry other men he they're strictly married to the king so the king can marry multiple women but each woman can only marry one person oops I kind of already have the line drone drawn so they can only marry one person they're not able to go marry another guy that would be oh no way that ain't going to happen Off With Their Heads see what I'm saying it's not going to work so that is a one to many relationship that's all I have to say about one to many relationships next video be talking about many to many see you around
