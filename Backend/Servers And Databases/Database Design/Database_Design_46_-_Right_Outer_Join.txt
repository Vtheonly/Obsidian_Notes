welcome back everybody this video will be a continuation of the last video about left joints so let's get right to it we're going to be talking about right outer joints now the right outer joins work basically the same way as the left outer joins but instead of the left table it's going to be the right table that keeps all of the the rows now if you don't know what I'm talking about please watch the last video or two that's going to solidify your knowledge and you'll be like ready to tackle this because I'm not trying to get you to watch my other videos I'm trying to teach you something that's a requirement to understand this and I don't want to have to retach it all for the sake of one little concept so let's draw this out a little bit we have it to where we have two tables a us or a customer table and a card table so this would be like for a bank or something and let's first see how what a left join would do a left join would take all of these customers and then it will take only the car cards that have an Associated customer and return those so we'd return we' basically connect the dots and then we would get a uh a join view which is going to list all of the customers but only the cards that have a customer so it's just going to be like customer list a card they have and if they have another card it's going to list that customer again list the card they have and we discussed that in depth in the last video well for a right joint it's going to work the same way except now it's going to to do it for the other table so we're going to have the same exact setup we're going to have a card I mean a customer and card table and a card table now if we set it up with a right outer join it's going to take all of the cards put them in the join table so we'll have every single card and then it will list the associated owner of that card so card and then the customer now there's something to consider with this if we set it to where within the card table we have customer ID we give that a column characteristic of not null that's going to that might confuse you a little bit because then every single card here is going to have an Associated customer which kind of that's the whole point of the right outter join or the left outer join for that sake is to include the rows that don't have that Association so if it's set to not null it's going to return them all anyways whether you use the right outer join and so forth you guys understand because basically if we use the right outer join for this it's going to return them all but it's going to return them all anyways because every single one has an Associated card we'll discuss that more in the future don't worry about it now there's something else to consider this basically works the same exact way is the left outer join except it's switched around so when we discussed in the last video how you could say which table was the left right where the from so you have basically the form be like select maybe and then you'd have like the columns first name last name and a card amount or or um you can have yeah card amount that's good and then you have something that says like from well the column that you put right here or the table you put right there is considered left when we're talking about this design stuff so in theory you could switch it around to where a left join works the same way as a right join you're just switching the direction of the tables so in practice most people don't even use right joins I'm only teaching you so you understand when you see one instead of using a right join they'll often use a left join and then they'll just flip the column the the tables I'm sorry so like this you have a your two tables and I'll give you two possibilities that are going to give the same result you could have your uh customer and then the card and you can use a right outer join or you could have it to where you have over here you have the card and the customer with the same exact columns and same exact foreign Keys nothing changed except in design you just switch the things and when you make the SQL statement you're going to switch the location of the call of the tables within that statement but overall the function works exactly the same and now you're going to use a left outer join these are going to return the same exact thing because if you do this one it's going to return all of these rows and the associated columns with those rows if you do this it's going to return all of those rows and all the associated columns with those rows so either way you're getting all the cards in part of the customers see so in practice a lot of people only use left outer joins for consistency and Clarity so if someone else sees it they already know it's a left out join they don't have to worry about left or right and then draw it out and get all confused most people just use left outer joins but you can always use right outer joins if you really wish that is up to you so yeah that's all for write outter joins uh there's one other type of join which we have not discussed and that's full outer joint thanks for watching And subscribe
