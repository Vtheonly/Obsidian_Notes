hey everyone welcome back to your database design Series this video we're going to be talking about surrogate and natural Keys all right let me write that out so we got S I think I'm spelling this right by the way surit and then we have natural all right so we talked about primary keys in the last video that's as far as we'll get for defining a key these are categories of primary keys so we Define a primary key and then this is just kind of like a descriptive term we don't have to Define in our database surrogate primary key or natural primary key this is more for database design to know like the difference between types of keys hopefully that makes clear sense and if not just stick with me all right okay so up up to like all these key videos I've been doing I've been using natural Keys let's define a natural key first it's very natural definition it's something that's naturally in the table something you naturally want to store when you have a user's table you naturally want to store the username and the email those can be used as natural keys because they fit all the requirements for a primary key and it's already in there you don't have to make up something you you don't have to think of a column to add just for the sake of having a key we want to be able to have a key for every single table but sometimes the natural key is not very obvious or not so natural so we want to try to find a natural key when we're using natural Keys generally when you create a database so let's say this huge box is our database within this database we have a bunch of tables and then within each table we have a bunch of columns and rows see what I'm saying these are all connected in some funky way with uh relationships well when we Define a database typically I mean maybe not always we want to try to either always use natural keys or always use surrogate Keys which are just madeup Keys we don't want to kind of flip-flop switch and I can't think of any other words because we want to try to keep it consistent otherwise people using the database are going to be confused is this a natural key or is this a surrogate key is this something that actually has real world value or is it just a madeup number so uh let's say we are using natural keys there are a couple problems with natural keys and this video will be explaining the difference between these two and then the next video we'll be talking about pros and cons of each basically so natural keys are what's naturally already in the table something we wanted to store to begin with right the thing is they have real world value so your database might adapt and the meaning of your keys kind of adapt too which once again I'll explain that all in the next video surrogate keys they are a column that's just added to your database no matter what even if you have a good natural key because remember you want to either use all natural or all surrogate usually so if I decide to use surrogate keys I'm going to give an ID to every single row within every single table so we have let's say we have a a user table and then we have a sale table and then we have a um comment table what we do is we give every single table an ID column so we have a user ID column in the in the user table we have a sale ID column in the sale table we have a comment ID in the comment table so now when we have like let's look at the comment table in depth we have the comments we're going to have a column we're going to have a column for the comment ID and then we'll need a reference to the user that posted the comment so we'll have the user ID as a foreign key which points back to the user table so that's kind of how that works now we just have random numbers the the ID is just a big number that has a feature known as autoincrement that means every single time you make a new row within this table it's going to raise the ID by one then when you like delete columns or something and you have gaps within your numbers it doesn't really matter because the number has no real world significance typically surrogate keys are kept completely private no one knows the surrogate key except for the people working with the database you're not told your surrogate key so if I created an account on a website and then I put my username in my password and then I go to like I sign up register and do my email junk and then I sign in and go to my user settings it's not going to be like user ID equals 45 or whatever it's going to be private the reason for that is is because the world doesn't have I mean the uh the number doesn't have real world meaning therefore it's private to the database only if I started giving that number out to everybody who has one of these IDs or or something like that or if I started putting it on sales reports well then I'm giving that number real meaning in the world and it's starting to become a natural key so hopefully that kind of makes sense natural is something that's already in the database surrogate is something we just add the thing that's kind of cool about surate is if you're struggling to find a really good natural key you can always use a surate key the uh problem with that is you always want to try to be able to naturally make everything unique like in a user table we have a username that's going to keep things unique so even if we use a surrogate key we can still Index this username and that can be used sort of as if we assign it as a natural key the only thing is we're making connections between tables using the surrogate key so for this table we could have a user ID and then we could have a username for just an example the user ID would be the surrogate key this would not be the natural key because we can only have one primary key and the primary key is going to be the type surrogate so the user ID is a surrogate key random number generated number the username we can index it and use it like a natural key with uh when we search the database and everything but we're not going to use it to make connections between tables and references with foreign keys so hopefully that makes things pretty clear next video I'll be talking about pros and cons of which one you want to use Okay so so cool catch you guys in the next video and be sure to subscribe
