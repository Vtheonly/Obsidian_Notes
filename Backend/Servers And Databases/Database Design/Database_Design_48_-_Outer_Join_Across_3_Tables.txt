hey guys welcome back this video we will be discussing using outer joins when there are three or more tables we will be discussing the example using three tables but you can basically apply it to any example as long as you understand the concepts I really recommend that you watch the video about using inner joints when there are three or more tables because the concepts are going to be basically the same except different results will be uh returned so for this the best way to think about it is let's say we have three tables if ignore these two right now we have a user comment and video table so basically it's a system where you can comment on videos each video that does get a comment will be in this table and every user that posts a comment will also be in this table connected with that video right what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a left outer joint on this side and a right outer joint on this side and we will just see what those results are like all right so first thing is first let's join the user and comment table that's the best way to think about it is to imagine these two tables being joined here to make a new temporary joined table and then imagine this new temporary table being joined with the third table to give a final result join table so if we do a left out or join here every single user is going to be brought down to this table in the situation of a left outer join it will only take the comments that have users because there has to be an association of the user ID in both tables for that but it's likely that every comment is going to have an Associated user because that that user ID column will likely be set to not null that way you don't have comments that aren't posted by anybody because that would be weird so this will also return all comments great now that we have that new table you see we basically Bally just took everything from up here let's imagine taking this and joining it with the videos and we're going to use a right outer join so this is going to be right outer join for right outer join we are going to take all of the videos and bring them down here that's basically how right outer joins work they will automatically take every single Row from the right table and then we're going to take any Row in this table that has an association with the video table so that means the comments will have to have a video which all of them will all right so what what will be removed here well some of the users will be removed the reason that is is because some of the users aren't going to be in the comment table and if they're not in the comment table they can't have an association with the video table so think about the join statements here we'll likely have something where it's like a user ID over here is equal to the user ID over here and then we'll have it to where [Music] it's then we'll have it to where it's a video ID over here and that's equal to a video ID over here so when we grab all of these we have all the users and all the comments because all the users will have a user ID and we don't have to have those users in the comment table because it's a left outer join which automatically takes all of the users all of the comments will be return because every comment will have an Associated user but once we get over here it gets a little different now it's about the video not the user so we are going to take all of the comments that have a video ID and all of the videos that have a video ID because it's a right outer join we're going to take all the videos whether or not they have a video ID in the comment table so the first thing take all the videos we're also going to take all of the comments but we're only going to take some users the reason that is is because if a user let's give some example data let's say we have a user over here with the ID of seven and he he doesn't leave a comment but because we do a left outer join he comes down here anyway so now he's in this new generated table well he has a user ID but does he have a video ID in the comment table to be associated with the video ID in the video table no he does not so he wouldn't make it on past this stage and he wouldn't be in this final outer table or this joined table so the final result is going to be all videos all comments and some users that's just an example of using right and left outer joins when there's three tables uh you could do the same thing with inner joins so if you did an in join it's only going to take the uh users who have comments so I mean you can basically apply the same example to a lot of different situations to get the results you want as long as you understand how a left join Works how a right join works and how an inner join works you can get essentially everything you really need to get the only one we haven't really discussed is the full outer join which you might need sometimes and uh that's a little different so we'll be talking about that soon so thank you guys for watching I'll see you in the next video peace out
