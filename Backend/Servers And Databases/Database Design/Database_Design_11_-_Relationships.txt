hey what's up everyone uh this video will be about relationships and I don't mean relationships as in dating advice because I probably couldn't give any of that but besides that we're going over database relationships so what is a relationship well in in a database everything is connected it's think of it like a giant web somehow something is connected to something else rather than storing everything in a giant table sorry my my uh board's kind of wet so it's not really writing very well we split that and then we have two smaller tables for manageable data Simplicity as well as a data Integrity reasons so now we still have to maintain the connection between data so we take one huge table break it into two tables and then we have what's known as a relationship there are multiple kinds of relationships and we'll be talking about that in the next video but for this video we'll be talking about the general concept of relationships so relationships talk about entities an entity is anything we store data about so this is an entity and this is an entity and they are related in some way they're connected there's a relationship between them this eraser is crap die there we go he such a junk okay there we go except now my chalkboards all wet all right where was I so we have to worry about entities there's two terms that we talked about earlier entities and attributes entities are anything we store data about attributes are the things we store about the data well when it comes to entities wait that attributes are what we store about the entities so U basically we have entities and then we have the attributes for that entity right and then we have a different entity so that is part of our database design we figure out all of the things we're storing data about think of like a college we could store information about the student the professor the classes the uh faculty the whatever else so we can have multiple entities and then multiple attributes about that entity and then we could have a third ID entity so just think uh student Professor class this is all part of our database our database so our database structure consists of three entities and attributes about each one of those entities what's an example of an attribute well it could be the student's name the student's address the class they're taking the uh what they're whatever it doesn't really matter they're a major that's another entity we could have an entity about the the majors such as science or whatever else and then we can have attributes for that like the classes that are required to get that major how long it takes and so forth that will become part of our database structure well these are still related in some way because we have have a student is a student uh is going to school for a major so there's a connection from this entity down to the major so let's just replace these with like right here's student and then okay that looks like crap can have let's put some specific examples in here we could have a student we could have a uh Professor Pro U then we could have class and then we can have major well a student goes to school to get a major a student takes classes the classes are taught by a professor the professors typically have a specific um area in that they teach so they might be part of the major like the major like the teachers for that major whatever uh students yeah you you get the point everything's connected so when we design relationships that tells us how we want to structure our tables that's going to make a lot more sense in the next video so I just wanted to introduce the idea of relationships in this video the next video we'll be talking about a specific kind of relationship so one 2 one that is a type of relationship there are two other ones one two many and many to many here are our three types of relationship and we will be talking about each one of these individually in the next three videos so hopefully um you are interested in seeing those this is when we really get started with actually designing databases all right so thank you for watching and be sure to subscribe click like and I'll see you in the next video peace
