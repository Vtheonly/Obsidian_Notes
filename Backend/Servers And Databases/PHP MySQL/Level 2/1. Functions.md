Functions are self-contained blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming, crucial for writing organized, reusable, and maintainable PHP applications.

### `1. Why Use Functions?`

Imagine you need to perform the same calculation or display the same formatted data multiple times throughout your application. Without functions, you'd have to copy and paste the same lines of code repeatedly. Functions solve this problem:

*   **Reusability:** Write code once, use it many times.
*   **Modularity:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function handles one specific task.
*   **Readability:** Code becomes easier to understand when logic is grouped into named functions.
*   **Maintainability:** If you need to change how a specific task is done, you only change it in one place (the function definition), and the change applies everywhere the function is called.
*   **Reduced Bugs:** Less copied code means fewer places for errors to hide.

---

### `2. Defining a Function`

Functions are defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the function's name, a pair of parentheses `()`, and a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

#### **Basic Syntax:**

```php
<?php
  function functionName() {
    // Code to be executed
    echo "Hello from inside the function!<br>";
  }
?>
```

#### **Naming Conventions:**
*   Function names should be descriptive and reflect what the function does.
*   They typically use `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `getUserData`).
*   Function names must start with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores. They are not case-sensitive, but it's *highly* recommended to always call them with the same casing as defined.

### `3. Calling a Function`

To execute the code inside a function, you simply call it by its name followed by parentheses and a semicolon.

```php
<?php
  function sayHello() {
    echo "Hello, PHP Learner!<br>";
  }

  // Call the function
  sayHello(); // Output: Hello, PHP Learner!
  sayHello(); // Output: Hello, PHP Learner!
?>
```

---

### `4. Function Parameters (Arguments)`

Functions can accept input values, called **parameters** (or arguments), that influence their behavior. Parameters are listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

#### **Required Parameters:**
The function expects these parameters to be provided when it's called.

```php
<?php
  function greet($name) {
    echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($name) . "!<br>";
  }

  greet('Mario'); // Output: Hello, Mario!
  greet('Peach'); // Output: Hello, Peach!

  // If you forget a required argument, PHP will throw a Fatal Error.
  // greet(); // Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError
?>
```
> **Security Note:** Notice the use of `htmlspecialchars()` here. If `$name` were to come from user input, this would prevent XSS attacks.

#### **Default Parameters:**
You can specify a default value for a parameter. If the caller doesn't provide an argument for that parameter, the default value will be used. Default parameters *must* come after any non-default (required) parameters.

```php
<?php
  function greetUser($name = 'Guest', $greeting = 'Hello') {
    echo htmlspecialchars($greeting) . ", " . htmlspecialchars($name) . "!<br>";
  }

  greetUser('Yoshi');           // Output: Hello, Yoshi! (uses default greeting)
  greetUser();                  // Output: Hello, Guest! (uses both defaults)
  greetUser('Shaun', 'Welcome'); // Output: Welcome, Shaun!
?>
```

#### **Type Declarations (Type Hinting) - PHP 7+:**
You can specify the expected data type for parameters and return values. This makes your code more robust and readable, helping catch errors early.

```php
<?php
  function addNumbers(int $num1, int $num2): int {
    return $num1 + $num2;
  }

  echo addNumbers(10, 20); // Output: 30

  // If you try to pass a string where an int is expected (by default, PHP will try to convert)
  // addNumbers('5', '10'); // This would usually work due to loose typing, but with 'strict_types', it would error.

  // To enforce strict types, add `declare(strict_types=1);` at the very top of your PHP file.
  // This is highly recommended for modern PHP development.
?>
```

### `5. Returning Values`

Functions can send a value back to the code that called them using the `return` statement. This is how functions process data and provide results.

*   `return` immediately exits the function. Any code after `return` will not be executed.
*   A function can return any data type: string, number, boolean, array, object, `null`, etc.

#### **Returning a Single Value:**

```php
<?php
  function calculateArea(int $width, int $height): int {
    $area = $width * $height;
    return $area; // Send the calculated area back
    echo "This line will never be reached."; // Code after return is ignored
  }

  $roomArea = calculateArea(5, 8); // $roomArea now holds the value 40
  echo "The room's area is " . $roomArea . " square meters.<br>";

  // You can also use the returned value directly in an expression
  echo "The building's total area is " . (calculateArea(10, 15) + calculateArea(20, 25)) . " square meters.<br>";
?>
```

#### **Returning Multiple Values (using an Array):**
If you need to return more than one piece of information, you can package them into an array.

```php
<?php
  function getUserInfo(string $id): array {
    // In a real app, you'd fetch this from a database
    if ($id === 'user123') {
      return ['name' => 'Alice', 'age' => 30, 'email' => 'alice@example.com'];
    } else {
      return ['name' => 'Unknown', 'age' => 0, 'email' => ''];
    }
  }

  $user = getUserInfo('user123');
  echo "User Name: " . htmlspecialchars($user['name']) . ", Age: " . htmlspecialchars($user['age']) . "<br>";

  // You can also use list() or array destructuring (PHP 7.1+) to extract values
  ['name' => $userName, 'age' => $userAge] = getUserInfo('user123');
  echo "User Name (destructured): " . htmlspecialchars($userName) . "<br>";
?>
```

### `6. Variable Scope`

The **scope** of a variable refers to the context in which it is defined and accessible.

#### **Local Scope:**
Variables declared *inside* a function are **local** to that function. They cannot be accessed from outside the function, and they "disappear" once the function finishes executing.

```php
<?php
  $globalVar = "I'm global!"; // Global scope

  function showScope() {
    $localVar = "I'm local!"; // Local scope to showScope()
    echo $localVar . "<br>";
    // echo $globalVar; // This would cause a Notice: Undefined variable
  }

  showScope(); // Output: I'm local!
  // echo $localVar; // Fatal Error: Call to undefined function
?>
```

#### **Global Keyword (Discouraged):**
The `global` keyword allows a function to access variables defined in the global scope. While it works, it's generally **discouraged** as it makes functions less independent and harder to debug (they rely on external state).

*   **Better Practice:** Pass global variables as arguments to the function, or use constants for truly global values.

```php
<?php
  $secretKey = 'my_super_secret_key';

  function displaySecret() {
    global $secretKey; // Access the global variable
    echo "The secret is: " . $secretKey . "<br>";
  }

  displaySecret(); // Output: The secret is: my_super_secret_key
?>
```

#### **Static Variables (Briefly):**
A `static` variable within a function retains its value between function calls, but is still only accessible within that function. Useful for counters or memoization, but less common for beginners.

### `7. Anonymous Functions (Closures)`

These are functions without a name, often used as arguments to other functions (callbacks) or assigned to variables.

```php
<?php
  $sayGoodbye = function($name) {
    echo "Goodbye, " . htmlspecialchars($name) . "!<br>";
  }; // Note the semicolon!

  $sayGoodbye('Luigi'); // Output: Goodbye, Luigi!

  // Used in array_map:
  $numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  $doubled = array_map(function($n) { return $n * 2; }, $numbers);
  // print_r($doubled); // Array ( [0] => 2 [1] => 4 [2] => 6 )
?>
```

---

### `8. Arrow Functions (PHP 7.4+) `

A concise syntax for simple anonymous functions, especially useful for one-liners.

```php
<?php
  $multiply = fn($a, $b) => $a * $b;

  echo $multiply(5, 3); // Output: 15
?>
```

---

### `Best Practices for Functions`

*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function should do one thing and do it well.
*   **Meaningful Names:** Function names should clearly describe their purpose.
*   **Limit Parameters:** If a function takes too many parameters, it might be doing too much, or the parameters could be grouped into an array or object.
*   **Avoid Side Effects (where possible):** Ideally, a function should only affect its own scope and return a value, rather than modifying global variables or printing directly to output (unless that's its explicit purpose, like a `display` function).
*   **Type Hinting:** Use type declarations for parameters and return types to improve code quality and readability.
